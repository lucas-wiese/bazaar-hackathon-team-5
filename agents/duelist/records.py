"""One file per duel, kept in the repo, so every duel we play can be studied and the agent improved.

The runner's JSONL log (`logs/duelist/`, gitignored) is the raw trace of one run. A record is the whole duel in one
place, whichever run saw it: the session, how we read it, every raw payload, every decision with its latency and
cost, what we sent, the game's final payload, and our score before and after. Records live in `docs/duels/` and are
committed, so the team shares them and they survive a restart or a lost laptop. Nothing secret goes in them: the
payloads carry our limit for that duel, which means nothing once the duel is over.

Also kept: the public feed's duel events (`feed.jsonl`), which may name the team behind a rival's alias, and
`review` turns all of it into one table (`docs/duels/README.md`).
