"""The duel loop: poll the game, let the agent decide for each live duel that needs a move, send the move.

A duel needs a move when the rival has moved, in its last DECIDE_LEFT ticks whatever the rival does, when both
sides have sat still for HOLD_TICKS ticks, when a rival that has said nothing is due our next step
(`silent_rival`: code, no model), when code should accept its standing offer (`closing`): the
deadline is ACCEPT_BY ticks away, or the gap is smaller than what one more round risks, and, with days, when code
offers their day once near the end (`agent.late_switch`). Each duel accepts on its own: duel accepts aren't limited
per team (organisers, Sat 16:55: "the accept only limits markets, not duels"), so all six of a wave may accept in
one tick. An acceptance the game refuses for the tick (`wait_for_tick`, `accept_taken`, 429) is sent again on the
next one. In a days duel we wait up to OPEN_WAIT ticks for the rival's first offer before opening, so the opener
can follow the day rules on their day. With days, the code rules weigh whole packages (`guards.worth`); a days
duel whose weight we can't read stays with the models (`by_code`).

Rules it keeps (RULES.md): one message per duel per tick, 5 requests a second per key. A poll is two reads (`clock`, `duels`) every `poll_s` seconds while a duel is live, every IDLE_POLL_S (at
most a third of a tick) while none is, since the key's 5 requests a second are the team's; each duel then costs one
write per tick at most. The SDK is synchronous, so every call runs in a thread and the model calls of several duels overlap.
