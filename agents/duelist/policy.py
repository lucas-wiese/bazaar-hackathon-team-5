"""Code-first moves (`--policy code`, Chief Sat 22:00, for Aleks's review): code decides accept / hold / step and
the day; one model call writes only the words, within TEXT_TIMEOUT_S, else code's plain text.

Why: Duels II's model decisions took 9.2 s on average (p90 12.4 s, max 20 s, 29% over 10 s; docs/duels, 270
decisions): the strategist alone 6.9 s, the negotiator 2.4 s, and 14% of decisions sent a second negotiator call after
a vetoed draft. At 15 s ticks the runner's whole-decision budget is 10 s, so about a third of model moves would turn
into fallbacks. Here a decision is one text call, capped, and never a retry: the words are checked by the same guards
(no claims, no stray or past-limit numbers, no agreement words unless accepting) and replaced by code's plain text
when they fail, so a decision takes at most about TEXT_TIMEOUT_S plus code time.

The moves follow the Duel Lab's simulated policy (intel/duel-lab.md; v1 simulator, Sat 15:50), with the duelist's code
rules unchanged around them (the runner's deadline / small-gap accepts, the silent walk, the late day switch):
- opener: OPENER_SHARE of our limit away from it, in PRICE, on our day (Duels I openers: median 0.42 of the limit,
  the simulator's U; Duels II's model opened at 0.51). Not in worth: since the seller's day bonus counts from day 0
  (DayValues.offset), worth at day 10 carries up to ~50 P the rival never sees, and a worth-based opener came out at
  67 on a 69 limit, or -2 P (replay of Duels II's 287 model decisions, Sat 22:30);
- each move after: concede CODE_STEP_SHARE of the gap between the standing offers, in worth, cut to MAX_STEP_SHARE
  and held when below `min_step`, as `agent.held` does for the models. Simulated (the v1 simulator, Sunday's 12
  ticks at 10% decay, 6,000 duels a world, paired against today's model steps capped at 25%): 12% wins in all four
  rival worlds (+0.008 to +0.010 a duel, every CI above 0); 15% +0.005 to +0.013; 20% and 25% lose in one or two;
  in the last CLOSING_TICKS: END_STEP_SHARE of the gap, never held or cut;
- accept their standing offer when it is worth ACCEPT_RATIO of our own (1.0: as good), or within ACCEPT_NEAR_P of
  where our step lands. The replay: the model accepted 10 offers worth 62-93% of ours with 3-7 ticks left (all
  closed); the simulator finds an accept ratio neutral at 0.85+ and slightly worse at 0.75, so it stays off by
  default, tunable in run/duel_params.json;
- the day: the day rules' call (`agent.day_read`): take their day, give it (worth up by its cost: the premium), or
  hold ours (a menu holds ours too; the words may name the other package);
- never past our limit: the step stops at our limit on the day offered, and `agent.final` checks the move again.
What it gives up: the strategist's reading of the rival's words (bluffs, deadlines, menus). It plays the numbers only.
