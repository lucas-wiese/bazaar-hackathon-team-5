"""What each delivery day is worth to us, read from the duel's `your_days_weight` and `days_meaning`.

Duels II settles a price and a delivery day from 0 to 10, and each side has a private weight per day (RULES.md).
Friday's practice showed neither field (both null), so this reads the shapes the weight is likely to take:
- a list of 11 numbers, or a dict keyed by day ("0" to "10"): what each day is worth;
- a number w: w per day toward the days we prefer, which `days_meaning` names ("each day later costs you w");
  a negative w with no such words prefers the early days (w x day);
- a dict with a number per day and a direction ({"per_day": 2, "prefers": "early"}) or a best day
  ({"best_day": 3, "per_day": 1.5}: each day away from it costs 1.5).

Values are stated against our best day, so every day is worth 0 or less. If the game counts the day as a cost,
that is exact; if as a bonus, it errs on the safe side by a constant. When the direction is a guess (`sure`
False), each day counts at the worse of the early and late readings. Any other shape reads as None: code leaves
the duel to the models, who get the raw weight.

The first deals of Duels II tell whether the reading is right: `review` sets our predicted result next to the
game's (`records.summary`). If they differ, fix the reading here.
