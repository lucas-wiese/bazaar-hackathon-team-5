"""Clock-Standing for the duels: a strategist sets the band, a negotiator writes the message inside it, code holds
the move to the band and the hard limits (regateo agents/ranged/v4, config clock-standing: `hold`, `standing`
and `clock` on, the negotiator never told our limit).

Code states facts only: offers so far, how far each side has moved, ticks left, rounds and what one more costs, the
gap. Prices and when to accept stay with the models, with three exceptions:
- the fallback when both models fail (`safe_move`) concedes on a schedule and accepts once their offer meets it,
  so a duel still closes;
- code accepts a standing offer inside our limit when the runner says the acceptance can't wait (`close`);
- code walks our offer toward a floor while the rival has said nothing at all since our opener (`silent_move`).

Decay is per round, not per tick: result = our surplus x (1 - decay)^rounds, with rounds = min(our messages,
theirs), priced or not (practice duel 277: our three no-price messages each added a round). Sending nothing is the
only free hold, so the runner never sends a move that only holds our offer.

With the delivery day (Duels II), every limit check is on the whole package: the price's margin over our limit
plus what the day is worth to us (`guards.worth`, `days.read_days`). When we can't read the day weight, the
checks fall back to price alone and the code rules above leave the duel to the models.

The delivery day: set "days" (0 to 10) every turn. Each side values the day privately, and the pie is biggest on the day that suits the side that cares more about it. The facts below the conversation read their day against yours and give the call these rules make:
1. Their first priced offer names their day: most rivals open on their own best day.
2. If their day costs you at most {f(DAY_SAME_SIDE_P)} (the facts say it is on your side), take it at once and haggle the price only.
3. If it is on the other side, C is what their day costs you (the facts give it):
   - Your day weight is low (the facts say how it ranks among this session's weights): give them their day in your first or second offer, with the price moved by C plus a premium of about C (a seller asks more, a buyer offers less). The deal is worth no less to you, and the bigger pie is shared.
   - Your day weight is high: hold your day and haggle the price as usual. Don't pay to keep it: a rival that knows what its day is worth already prices that in.
   - In between: offer one package and name the other in the angle as a menu in words ("day 0 at 120, or day 10 at 105"). It costs no extra round, and their next offer shows which they value.
4. Never settle on a middle day when each day costs you the same (your best day is 0 or 10): the pie is biggest at one end, and a middle day throws away half the gain. A middle day from them says nothing about which end they prefer: answer with your own end and haggle the price.
5. Settle the day within your first two messages, then keep it: at this decay, haggling over two issues is expensive.
6. If your system says which days you prefer is a guess, don't give the day first; follow their day only if it costs you at most {f(DAY_SAME_SIDE_P)} at the worse reading.
