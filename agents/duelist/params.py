"""Hot-reloaded tuning parameters (Chief, Sat 22:00, for the Duel Lab's tuner between waves): run/duel_params.json
holds overrides of the duelist's code constants, re-read every tick, so a tuned value takes effect on the next tick
with no restart.

    {"_note": "wave 3 proposal, approved by Aleks 09:12", "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.15, "HOLD_TICKS": 5}

- Defaults are today's constants, read from the modules at start: a key absent from the file (or no file) means the
  default, so deleting a line or the file reverts it.
- Every key is bounds-checked (SPEC) and the set is cross-checked (MIN_STEP_SHARE <= MAX_STEP_SHARE, ...). A file
  with any bad key, a bad value or broken JSON changes NOTHING: the last good set stays and the error is logged, so a
  half-written tuning never plays.
- Every change is logged (old → new) by the runner, to the console and the JSONL log, and each new duel's record
  carries the effective set.
- Keys starting with "_" are notes. The constants are module globals read at call time, so setting them on the module
  is all a change needs (the strategist's prompt text names some of them: a new value reaches the prompt of duels that
  start after it).

The duelist runs on Aleks's machine: the file is the one under that checkout's run/ (or --params / DUEL_PARAMS).
`tools/duel_loop.py use <set>` (a whole approved set, replacing the file), `switch` (the Duel Lab's rule, once) and
`approve` (a proposal's keys) write it; nothing else does.

A MISSING file never plays silently (audit S2, Sun 01:00): run/ is gitignored, so a restart from another checkout
would play the code constants. The duelist then plays the default set of docs/duel_sets.json (git-tracked: the sets
Aleks approves, every set listing the same keys) and says so loudly at start and every 20 ticks; only when that file
is missing too do the code constants play, said just as loudly.

Mid-duel (audit S2): a change applies to the duels already running from their next decision on (every rule reads
the module globals when it runs); the strategist's prompt, written when a duel starts, names no tunable number, and
every decision's record carries the set it was decided under.
