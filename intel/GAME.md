# The Bazaar: what every agent must know (stable; edit only when the rules or a measured fact change)

## Scoring (RULES.md)
- Score = Negotiating 30 + Market-making 30 + Judges 40. Each day is a round; Friday counts half; rounds are averaged. Scores are relative to the field (ours drops when others rise).
- Negotiating = duels (share of each deal's pie) + dealer ladder (share of each dealer's price range; best 3 deals per level; higher levels weigh more; a missing deal counts 0) + **value gained in trades with other teams, at our private values**.
- Market-making = Market Test efficiency (bench, every ~2 h from Saturday) + value created between other teams on our venue. Fees never count.
- Never counts: number of trades, fees earned, pack luck, gifts.

## Measured facts (operator-maintained; verified Sat 00:00-01:15 by independent agents; [V] verified, [L] likely, [?] open)
- **No round cap on neg_points; the +50 is per trade** [V, Sun 12:17, tick 2169]: a team sale of RET-03 at 5 (worth 2.8) took `neg_points` 50.0 → 52.2. Earlier peaks: Fri 67.8, Sat 119.1 (data/me.jsonl). The Friday '50.0 exactly, uncapped 63.9' was ONE trade (−21.5 → +28.5) clipped at +50. RET-11's 0 (Sun 10:26) = its value at sale ≈ 227, not a cap.
**Dealer playbook (Sat 13:30, from today's measured deals; details in the entries below)**
1. A dealer deal scores min(0, ΔV − price): gains clip to 0, losses count in full. Buy only at ≤ our value, sell only at
   ≥ our value. Dealers pay only through the **ladder** (best 3 deals per level; L3 ≈ 3× L2: Pilar +0.050 vs Chato +0.017).
2. Ladder share = how far the price moves toward us inside the dealer's range. Step −2/−3 and let the dealer climb (Pilar
   MAL-06 +0.040); a jump to her bid triggers her final (SAL-08 +0.019). Our 6 Chato BUYS above his menu list never
   counted; a Chato SALE above his opening bid did. Never a deal at the dealer's opening price (RULES:35).
3. Dealers final after ~4-5 rounds and mirror our step size (Chato mocks +1/+2: "Two points is not moving").
4. A dealer's offer expires after 4 ticks: holding silent at our cap ends the talk. Move (never repeat) or walk.
5. `--offer-only` (send the dealer's own standing price as our offer) closes deals without our accept.
6. Finals seen Sat: Chato sells uncommon 30-31, rare 86-87 (our +3 steps from ~57, final once we reach ~69); Chato buys
   uncommon 14 (opening 13); Abuela sells common 9, uncommon 22-23, held 25 against our 22; Pilar buys uncommon 19 (MAL),
   SAL 23 (Team 4 got 25), epic 140 (LAV-11 from Team 8). Abuela gave a gift card after our 5th deal.
7. /api/me/value returns the value of ONE MORE copy; the held copy's value is in /api/me assets `your_value`.

- **Team trade** [V]: score = Δ(our whole collection value, incl. page bonus and unopened packs) − price − fee if WE accept.
  `parties` = [maker, taker]; only the taker pays the fee, ceil(5% × price) + 1 P per card. Being the maker saves the fee
  and the team's single accept per tick.
- **Dealer deal**: score = min(0, ΔV − price). Losses count in full [V: MAL-07 at 29 (worth 17.5) −11.8; LAV-05 sold at 5
  (worth 13) −8.0; LAV-09 at 93 (worth 91) −2.0]. Gains are clipped to 0 [L]. A dealer deal never adds `neg_points`.
- **Per-trade cap = 50** [V, n=2, Sat 10:27 cap test]: RET-01 (the RET page's last card, worth 83.9 with the page bonus)
  bought from Team 10 at 20 as MAKER (no fee): `neg_points` −21.5 → +28.5 = **+50.0 exactly**; uncapped would be 63.9.
  Rules out "gain ≤ 5×(price+fee)" (63.9) and "value ≤ 6×book" (40). Still open: flat 50 vs 5×book: both cases were
  commons (book 10 → 50); only a capped uncommon/rare close (5×book = 125/350) would separate them. Friday: LAV-05 at
  8 + 2 fee, value 99.1 → +50.0. Rule for pricing: a page-closer is worth at most 50 + price to us.
- **Page bonus** [V]: 25% of the page's book (265) × our multiplier = 66.25 × m (LAV 86.1, RET 72.9, CHA 106), priced into the
  last missing card (LAV-09 read 177.1 when it was the only one missing). It scores only when a TEAM trade completes the
  page [L: Team 17 +6.25 board via a team trade; Team 10 +2.1, Team 7 +1.1, Team 12 +1.0 via Chato].
- **Unopened packs drag** [V, Sat 15:30]: each new card lowers an unopened pack's expected value. SAL-06 bought from Abuela
  at 23 (worth 22.5): `neg_points` −2.7 instead of −0.5, while our unopened silver pack fell 92.9 → 90.5 (−2.4). Friday
  fits too (SAL-08 +1.9, SAL-06 +6.0, LAV-06 −2.3). Open packs before trading (ours is kept for the CHA release).
- **Relative score** [V]: the leader sits at the top of the scale; idle teams fall 0.07-1.7 per snapshot when others gain.
  1 `neg_point` ≈ 0.16 board points (Friday's marginal rate; [L] for Saturday).
- **El Chato** (level 2, 6 deals/team/hour) [V]:
  - Sells uncommons from 33; +1 per round → final 28-29 (Team 3); bigger early bids end at 31-32.
  - Sells rares from 97; constant +2 to +4 per round, bid just under his standing offer → 82-90 [L: one sale at 82, the
    other seven 89-93]; +1 steps give an early final at 91-93; big jumps earn ~1.
  - Buys uncommons at 13; if you open ≥ 39 and step down 2-3 he goes to a 15-16 final. Buys rares (paid 46 for LAT-09).
  - Silver pack: opens 188 (Team 8 paid 181, board −5.65). Never buy packs.
- **Abuela** (level 1, 8 deals/team/hour, 3 packs/hour) [V]: opens common 12, uncommon 29, pack 30; more rounds = lower
  (common 9-10, uncommon 21-24 after 5-7 rounds, pack 19 after 8). Each team's first deal was a fixed welcome price (17
  pack/uncommon, 7 common) [V; whether it resets each day: ?].
- **Ladder** [superseded by the playbook above]: Abuela deals moved ours (0.054 → 0.064); our 3 Chato deals did not, and no variable explains which Chato
  deals count. A deal at the dealer's opening price never counts [V, RULES]. Level 2 opened early to teams with 3
  negotiated Abuela deals [V].
- **Venues** [V]: 4 team venues exist (v01 Team 6 0.5%→0%, v02 Team 12 0%, v03 Team 13 1%, v04 Team 2 0% auto), all with 0
  trades on Friday. All 46 team trades went through El Rastro.
- **Addressed offers are NOT private** [V Sat 02:50]: an offer with `to` is hidden from public boards (the addressee sees it
  in `GET /api/me/offers`), but the public FEED's `offer.listed` event shows it in full: maker, `to`, give, want (35 such
  events on Friday). Anyone reading the feed sees what we bid for and whom we target: keep page-critical bids short-lived.
  Team 13's claim that only the addressee sees them is false. **Card-for-card swaps** exist (give assets, want
  cards). A venue's owner scores the value created between other teams on it: trading on a leader's venue feeds the leader
  (Team 13 lobbied every team on Sat 02:00 to trade and swap on its venue v03).
- **Clearing prices on El Rastro** [V]: common 9 (LAT 7.5), uncommon 24.5 (MAL 26, SAL 24.5, LAT 21.5), rare 70 (53-80).
  Only 5% of asks and 9% of bids filled; filled bids took a median 4 ticks.
- **Duels** [V, 30 practice duels; corrected Sat 09:48]: result = our surplus × (1 − decay)^rounds, rounds = min(our
  messages, theirs): **every duel message counts as a round, priced or not** (duel 277: 3 no-price messages each raised
  `rounds`; 278: restating the same price every tick cost 10 rounds). Silence is the only free hold; no deal = 0.
- **Round 2 (Sat)** [V]: fired at tick 160 (game hour ~2.7, not 4.0): `neg_points` 67.8 → 0 and `ladder_points` → 0 for
  every team; holdings carry over. Tick 165: grant = 150 P + a sobre_barrio pack for everyone (ours: RET-05, SAL-01,
  SAL-03). Saturday clock: game hour = wall hour (30 s ticks, 120 ticks/h).
- **Abuela on Saturday** [V, n=1]: our first deal of the day (RET-04 common) opened at 12 and closed negotiated at 9
  (worth 11): `neg_points` 0 → 0, `ladder_points` 0 → 0.014. No fixed welcome price today [L: the welcome price does not
  reset per day]. Menus Sat: Abuela common list 10, uncommon 25; Chato uncommon 26, rare 77, silver pack 150.
- **Dealer gains don't score** [V, n=2 clean windows, Sat 09:41-09:45]: Abuela RET-04 at 9 and RET-03 at 9 (worth 11
  each; collection value +22): `neg_points` 0 → 0 both times (predicted +2 each if gains counted). Dealer deals pay only
  through the ladder: Abuela commons +0.014, +0.018, +0.016 (3 deals, 12 → 9 each). The deck's Hint 1 "+4" is team trades.
- **Dealer losses score in full** [V, Sat 09:53]: RET-09 from Chato at 87 (worth 77): `neg_points` 0 → −10.0 exactly;
  ladder unchanged (4th Chato deal of ours that never moved it). His path: 97, 96, 95, 90, then FINAL 87 against our
  57 → 69 (+3 steps); Team 18 paid 86 for RET-09 at tick 206. RET-10 [V, 10:04]: first try his FINAL 91 came when our
  bid was 66 (walked, cap 88); retry: 97, 96, …, 89, FINAL 86 when our bid reached 69 → `neg_points` −10 → −19.0 (77 − 86).
  Pattern [L, n=3]: his rare final lands when our +3 steps reach ~69 (≈ 0.9 × list 77) → 86-87; at 66 it was 91.
- **Chato mirrors our step size** [V, Sat 10:07, RET-06 uncommon]: our 18 → 21 in +1 steps; his 33, 33, 32, FINAL 31
  after 4 rounds ("One peseta. That's your big move? … You moved one, I moved one. That's the last number I say").
  Friday's +1 → 28-29 protocol fails today; he finals after ~4-5 rounds whatever we do. RET uncommons go to Abuela.
- **Warm vs cold with Chato** [Open: confounded, the warm run also used +3 steps vs +1, and Chato mirrors step size; RULES: injected words change what dealers say, never their prices; prices V, effect of words not shown]: cold (open 18, +1, price-only text) → his 33, 33, 32, FINAL 31
  in 4 rounds, walked. Warm (open 20, +3, greeting/thanks/"for our Retiro page", Spanish mix) → his 33, 33, 33, 32, 31, then
  he ACCEPTED our 30 ("Done. 30 P.") in 5 rounds: `neg_points` −19 → −21.5 (27.5 − 30), ladder unchanged (Chato deal 5,
  still never moves the ladder). Abuela RET-08 at 22 (her 29 → 22): `neg_points` 0, ladder +0.003 (a 4th level-1 deal).
- **Offer life on Saturday** [V, probe tick 264]: the server halves `expires_in_ticks` (asked 60 → 30 ticks, 120 → 60,
  200 → 100): it counts in 60 s units (Friday's tick). Ask 2× the ticks you want.
- **A dealer SALE above his opening bid moves the ladder** [V, n=1, Sat 12:10]: LAT-08 (worth 12.5) sold to Chato at
  14, offer-only (we sent his standing 14 as our offer and he accepted): his bids 13 ×4, 14, 14; `ladder_points`
  0.055 → 0.072 (+0.017), `neg_points` unchanged (gain clipped). His uncommon buy final is 14 (MAL-07 earlier: 13, 13,
  14 FINAL vs our floor 15 → walked).
- **Level 3 (Pilar) ladder pays ~3× level 2** [V, n=1, Sat 12:24]: MAL-07 (worth 17.5) sold to Pilar at 19 (her bids 16,
  16, 17, 17, 18; she accepted our 19): `ladder_points` 0.072 → 0.122 (**+0.050**), `neg_points` unchanged, cash +19.
- **Ladder total Sat 12:31: 0.141** [V]: Abuela L1 ×5 → 0.055; Chato LAT-08 at 14 (L2) +0.017; Pilar MAL-07 at 19 +0.050,
  SAL-08 at 23 (her 22, 22, 23-final) +0.019 (L3). Diminishing (Analyst: cap near ~0.15 [L]). Pilar's MAL-06 thread: 16,
  16, 17, FINAL 17 in round 4 (walked at floor 18): her finals land around round 4, lower in a second thread.
- **Dealer ladder share depends on how we step** [V, n=2 at Pilar, Sat 12:45]: MAL-06 at 19 with small steps (asks
  30 → 28 → 26 → 24; her 16, 16, 17, 18, 19; we offered her 19) → +0.040; SAL-08 at 23 after our jump 34 → 31 → 28
  handed her a final (22, 22, 23f) → +0.019. Never jump to her bid; step −2/−3 and let her climb. Ladder 0.181 at 12:45.
- **Dealers compete for epics** [V, feed settlement 565, tick 550]: Team 8 sold LAV-11 (epic, book 180) to Pilar at 140
  while our addressed bid stepped 100 → 110 → 120. A team bid for an epic must beat what a dealer pays (~140), or it loses.
- **Dealer offers expire after 4 ticks** [V, Builder via /api/threads, Sat 13:25]: Chato's 32 (thread 805) and Abuela's 25
  (thread 832) lapsed 4 ticks after we went silent at our cap, and neither re-offered. Holding silent ends the talk; to
  keep it alive, move (never repeat a price) or walk. Drivers now walk after 4 ticks with no live dealer offer (e875b82).
- **Ladder and early unlock count only below-list dealer deals** [L, strong pattern]: every Abuela deal under her list
  (commons 9 vs 10, RET-08 22 vs 25) moved the ladder; none of our 6 Chato deals moved it, all above his list (RET-09 87 and
  RET-10 86 vs 77, RET-06 30 vs 26, Fri LAV-09 93, LAV-06 31, LAT-08 sale). Level 3 (Doña Pilar, active 3.51 h, open to
  all at 5.51 h): Team 13 unlocked her early at tick 262 by "3 deals with chato"; our 3 Chato deals today did not unlock it.
  Pilar: early unlock 3 Chato deals at level ≥ 2; sells gold packs (list 420); buys released uncommons/rares/epics and
  pays over book for SAL/RET; 6 deals/team/hour.
- **The Workshop** [V, Sat 16:15]: `POST /api/taller {"assets": [a, b, c]}`, three spare copies of one rarity (≥ 1 of each
  card kept) → one card of the next rarity. Ours: LAT-04 + SAL-01 + SAL-02 spares (5.6 P of value) → MAL-06 (worth 17.5):
  collection value +11.8, `neg_points` and `ladder_points` unchanged (not a scored deal, not a ladder level).
- **A correct flag = +10.0 neg_points** [V, Sat 16:38, clean window]: `POST /api/flags {"message_id": 7053, "reason": ...}` on a
  Los Pícaros message (L4 dealer, "bad faith: read every offer, flag a trick") claiming a card "stopped printing yesterday…
  after us, nobody has one" (false: print runs are fixed) → `neg_points` 43.2 → 53.2, ladder unchanged. A wrong flag costs
  (amount unknown). Los Pícaros: L4, early unlock = 2 Pilar deals; buys commons/uncommons, sells rares (list 63) and epics
  (162); opens bids low (MAL-06 at 10).
  Flag results [V, n=4, Sat 16:38-16:41]: +10 each for false FACTS: 7053, 7068 ('stopped printing yesterday'; a repeat in a
  separate message pays again) and 7160 (bait and switch: words sell SAL-09 'El Marqués', structured offer gives card:SAL-06).
  **−10** for 7170 (words 'final as a church bell', offer final:false, next offer lower): finality/urgency talk is posture,
  not a flaggable lie. Net +20. Rule: flag only a wrong card/price in the structured offer vs the words, or a false factual claim.
  Then 0 [V, Sat 16:53]: flag 5 (7225 'last one in all of Madrid', a thread we had closed), flag 6 (7344 bait and switch, live
  thread) and flag 7 (7356 'stopped printing', live thread) all scored 0. Same lie types as the +10 ones → [L] scored flags
  are capped (≈ 3 correct per team, per dealer or per hour?). Final: 7 flags, net +20.
  Probe [V, Sat 17:43, 62 min after the last scored flag]: flag 8 on 8507, an unmistakable bait and switch (words: 'Noche de
  Movida, that exact card, no other' = MAL-10; structured offer: card:MAL-07 at 73) → `{"flagged": true}`, `neg_points` 63.2
  → 63.2 after 90 s (0, not −10). So the cap does NOT reset after an hour: **flags are done for us (≈ 3 scored per team)**.
  Ladder also flat for the board [L, Chief 17:45]: `negotiating` 21.88 unchanged across ladder 0.373 → 0.437.
- **Team trades still move the board** [V, Sat 17:46-17:49]: the trader's swap (t07's SAL-07 for our LAT-01, +15.5 `neg_points`)
  → at the tick-910 refresh `negotiating` 21.74 → 22.48, board 29.24 → 29.98 (#4 → #3): ≈ +0.05 board per neg point. The
  board refreshes every ~10 ticks (5 min on Saturday). Ladder and flags are spent; team trades and v10 are the live levers.
- **SAL page close via a team trade** [V, Sat 18:28]: t08's open El Rastro ask, SAL-06 at 28 (fee 3), value 82.1 to us →
  `neg_points` +40.4 (not the +50 cap: our unopened silver pack's EV fell, pack drag). **Public boards mask makers**
  (`/api/venues/{v}/offers` shows e.g. 'ma88927b8'); the feed's `offer.listed` names the real team.
- **Easter egg (chulapa dorada)** [V feed, Sat]: ask Abuela about 'la chulapa dorada' (text only) → `egg.found` for the team
  (t05 at tick 1047); she points to Don Ernesto + 'el oro de Moscú', which paid t02 LAT-13 (print run 1) at 1021, then no
  more ('not mine today'). Score effect of egg.found alone: unknown.
  Pícaros egg [V, tick 1231]: text 'Conozco el timo de la estampita…' → egg.found + badge 'Trickster tricked' ('sin trucos para
  ti... hoy'); the Abuela egg gave badge 'Sharp ear'. Badges: score effect unknown.
  Castizo eggs [V, ticks 1368-1369]: Madrid references in dealer threads ('cocido con sus tres vuelcos', rosquillas de San Isidro)
  → Abuela egg.given MAL-06 + badge 'Castizo' (t10 got a sobre_barrio from Chato for Plaza Mayor + caña; not repeated for us).
- **Payday** [V, Sat 20:37, game paused at tick 1201]: every team +400 P ('a second starting purse… Only deals score, never
  cash you hold'). Ours 120 → 520.
- **CHA page closed Sunday by a team trade** [V, tick 1585]: 9 cards from dealers/pack at 0 neg (Pícaros CHA-09 55; Abuela 8/9/8/9/22/21; pack CHA-07/10), then the last (CHA-05, value 122 with the bonus) from t02 by our addressed El Rastro bid at 72 → neg 0 → 50 (cap). Total 196 P.
- **Broker announcements: 1 per venue per 20 ticks** [V, Sat 21:48: `wait: one announcement per venue every 20 ticks`].
- **`GET /api/cards/{id}` masks other holders** [V, Sun 03:00]: our cards show `owner: t05`; others `owner: "a team"`, and the history
  masks teams too ("to": "a team"), but shows each card's origin (pack # / El Taller / trade #). The server accepts cancels while closed.
- **Abuela gifts** [V, tick 261]: after our 5th Abuela deal of the day she gave us LAT-08 ("gift from Abuela Carmen",
  `gift.given`); Team 7 got LAT-06 the same way on Friday (tick 157). Gifts never score, but the card is ours to sell.
- **Value created on our venue is NET and can go negative** [V, Sat 11:30]: tick 311 on v10, t10 → t01 MAL-07 at 14:
  our `mm_points` +4.99 (market 7.5 → 12.5); tick 398 on v10, t10 → t15 SAL-07 at 26 (t15 dumps SAL): `mm_points`
  +4.99 → **−5.2**, market back to 7.5 (bench stall only), rank #3 → #7. [L] value created = buyer's value − seller's
  value: a card moving to a lower-multiplier holder subtracts from the venue owner.
- **RET rares** [V, feed ticks 160-188]: no team pulled a RET rare from a grant pack (every sobre_barrio `best` = null);
  the only sources are Chato (rare list 77) and silver packs. Team 15 bids 59 and Team 2 9-12 for RET-09/10.

## Our private values (`/api/me` → affinity; every team has the same six numbers, shuffled)
Chamberí (CHA) 1.6 (released Sunday) · Lavapiés (LAV) 1.3 · El Retiro (RET) 1.1 (released Saturday) · Salamanca (SAL) 0.9 · Malasaña (MAL) 0.7 · La Latina (LAT) 0.5.
Book values: common 10, uncommon 25, rare 70, epic 180, legendary 450. Our value = book × multiplier; a 2nd copy is worth 25%, a 3rd 10%. A complete page (commons + uncommons + rares of a set) adds a 25% bonus.

## What we can do (the executors)
- El Rastro: list a card for cash, bid cash for any copy of a card, accept others' offers (1 accept per team per tick), offers addressed to one team (`to`).
- `agents/trader/loop.py`: auto-accepts El Rastro offers that gain ≥3 (buys) / ≥6 (sells into bids).
- Autoflip (archived in `archive/fri/autoflip.py`): DEAD, dealer buys above value subtract. Never restart it.
- `agents/trader/trade.py`: manual list / bid / accept. `agents/dealers/abuela_bot.py`: dealer negotiation (`--dealer`, `--ladder`).
- Duels: Aleks's `agents/duelist/` (not ours to run).
- Humans in the room (Lucas, Dani) can find card holders and agree trades; card owners are anonymous in the API.
