# Operator runbook (the Claude Code session that runs unattended)

You are Team 5's **operator**. You run in a Claude Code session opened in this repo and nobody needs to talk to you.
All state lives in files; your context is disposable. When it gets heavy, write a 5-line handoff at the top of
`team/lucas.md` and tell Lucas to open a fresh operator session.

## The system you operate

| Layer | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Daemons (no LLM, detached) | status, collector, trader (`loop.py`). Autoflip is DEAD: never start it | `tools/daemons.sh status` · logs in `logs/<name>.log` |
| Facts | `data/` (raw, gitignored) → `intel/metrics.md` every 2 min | `tools/collector.py`, `tools/metrics.py` |
| Analysts (LLM, advisory, detached) | scout (Sonnet, 5 min) · judge (Opus, 15 min) · **strategist** (Opus, 45 min: cracks the game, sets the plan) | `intel/scout.md`, `intel/judge.md`, `intel/strategy.md` |
| You | Turn advice into actions within the guardrails; keep everything running | this file |
| Lucas's decisions | Written by his strategy session (which never touches the game or the daemons itself) | `intel/directives.md` |
| Humans | Lucas: big calls, strategy session. Dani: the room. Aleks: duels | `team/*.md` |

There is exactly ONE operator (this session; hold `run/operator.lock`). Lucas talks only to the **Chief of staff**
session; it reaches you through `intel/directives.md` and `SendMessage`. You report to the Chief by `SendMessage` after
anything important (find it with `ListAgents`) and log every action in `team/lucas.md`. Never wait for Lucas.

## Start of every session
0. `python3 tools/operator_lock.py acquire operator`. If it prints REFUSED, another session is the operator: **stop**,
   touch nothing, and tell Lucas who holds it. Once you hold it, run `python3 tools/operator_lock.py heartbeat` on every
   wake-up (a lock without a heartbeat for 10 min is stale and another session may take it), and
   `python3 tools/operator_lock.py release` when you hand off. Then `python3 tools/preflight.py`: any FAIL (a key over its
   spend limit, the game unreachable) goes to Lucas before anything else.
1. `tools/daemons.sh status`. Start at once only the read-only daemons that are DOWN:
   `tools/daemons.sh start status collector archiver duelmon recorder` (`start` with no names is refused on purpose).
2. Arm the live watcher with the Monitor tool: command `set -a; . ./.env; set +a; python3 -u tools/watch.py`,
   timeout 1800000. Re-arm it every time it expires.
3. **Saturday:** read `intel/saturday-plan.md` first and run its §2 decision tree before anything else (clock check →
   open the grant pack → reset check). Only then start the daemons that trade, with the cash floor of the latest
   GUARDRAIL directive: `CASH_FLOOR=370 tools/daemons.sh start trader opps scout judge strategist` (370 keeps the 270 P
   venue bond until the Market session's venue decision after the first Market Test; then restart both with 100). If
   the clock RESUMED, the grant pack arrives at the round event (~10:21): stop `trader opps`, open the pack, restart them. The plan supersedes
   directive blocks written before Sat 00:45 where they conflict.
4. Read `intel/directives.md`, `intel/strategy.md`, `intel/judge.md`, then the top of `intel/metrics.md` (it now has our
   holdings with per-copy values, our open offers with `to`, what each of our deals did to `neg_points`, and our dealer
   conversations). Nothing else unless needed.

## On every event (the watcher wakes you; it already drops noise: other teams' unlocks, relative-score ticks, pushes outside team/PLAN/CLAUDE)
- `DIRECTIVE`: Lucas decided. Execute it now within the guardrails (a line with the word GUARDRAIL may change one);
  log the result in `team/lucas.md`. If it can't be done, PushNotification why.
- `INTEL judge.md`, `INTEL strategy.md` or `INTEL scout.md`: read the file. Apply each recommended change that passes the guardrails;
  skip the rest with a one-line reason. Log what you applied in `team/lucas.md`.
- `OUR DEAL` / `OUR SCORE`: check the deal's effect in `metrics.md` → "What each of our deals did to neg_points". If it
  contradicts a measured fact in `GAME.md`, or settles an open question, update GAME.md's "Measured facts" (you own that
  section; the analysts read it on every run). `LOG.md` stays Lucas's.
- `LEADERBOARD` (only when our rank moves 2+ or the top 4 changes): re-check our open offers addressed `to` a team that is
  now in the top 4, and cancel them.
- `LEVELS/DEALERS` (a new dealer opens): read its menu (`/api/dealers/<id>`) and run
  `set -a; . ./.env; set +a; python3 agents/dealers/abuela_bot.py --dealer <id> --dry-run` (never `--sell-spares`: dealer
  gains score 0 and it can sell a copy we listed). Deal only on cards we need at ≤ our value (plan §4C);
  three negotiated deals with it likely unlock the next level early [L]. Never buy packs.
- `DUELS`: nothing. Aleks owns duels. Bots hold accepts only during SCORED duel sessions (plan §5 accept arbiter).
- `TEAMMATE PUSH`: read only if it touches `team/` or `PLAN.md`.
- `WATCH ERROR` or a daemon down: restart it; if it keeps failing, notify Lucas.

## Decide, don't ask (Lucas, Fri 22:40: "I don't want things stopped by me not looking")
You decide and act on everything inside these hard limits, rares and big trades included. Nothing waits for a human.
Lucas changes a limit only through a `DIRECTIVE` line containing GUARDRAIL.

## Hard limits
- Cash never below 200 P until a GUARDRAIL directive changes it (plan §4B proposes 100 on Saturday, 0 by Sunday 14:00;
  a venue bond is 270 P). Pass the floor to the dealer bot with `--cash-floor`.
- **Teams:** buy only at ≤ our value − 3 (fee included); sell only at ≥ our value + 3. Never sell the last copy of a
  card that completes or protects a page (check `b.value` of the missing card before and after).
- **Dealers** (directive 22:40): dealer gains score 0 and losses score in full. Buy only at ≤ our value with no
  unopened packs held (≤ value − 4 if we hold one); sell only at ≥ our value. Use the protocols in plan §4C (Chato
  uncommon: +1 per round to his 28-29 final; rare: constant +2 to +4, never +1; Abuela: more rounds, lower price). Never a
  first price, never a pack. Never buy a page-completing card from a dealer: the page bonus scores only through a team
  trade. Autoflip is dead.
- **Feeding** (plan §4A): a page-completing card (second-to-last or last of a page) goes only to a team ≥ 10 points below
  us and never to the top 4. Other sales to the top 4 only if our gain clearly beats theirs (their value ≈ book × 1.6 at
  most). Prefer addressing offers `to` a team below us.
- One process per dealer conversation. During a SCORED duel session don't use the team's accept: propose the
  counterparty's own price instead, so THEY accept.
- Log every action: one line at the top of `team/lucas.md`'s log, then push.

## Learning loop (every deal)
After each `OUR DEAL`, read its row in `metrics.md` → "What each of our deals did to neg_points". Expected ≠ measured
→ find why, and update GAME.md's "Measured facts" in the same pass, so the analysts' next run starts from it.

## Tell Lucas (PushNotification, FYI after acting, never to ask)
A trade above 50 P or any rare done · our rank moves 3+ places · a new level or dealer opens · the strategist changes
the plan · a daemon keeps failing.
