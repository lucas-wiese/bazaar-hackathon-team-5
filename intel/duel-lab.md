# Duel Lab: Duels II recommendations (Sat 16:15, for Aleks's decision; analysis only)

_Lucas's Duel Lab session. It never writes to the game or to `agents/duelist/`._
- _**Inputs:** our 68 records in `docs/duels/` (Duels I = session 2, the practice round = session 1),
  `docs/duels/scores.jsonl`, `docs/duels-1-review.md`, `intel/score-model.md` §1d-1e, the organisers' Duels deck, and
  the merged duelist (4699673)._
- _**Sources:** code and raw outputs are in the session scratchpad (`lab/`: `sim.py`, `validate.out`, `final.out`,
  `search3.out`, `extra.out`, `replay.out`, `fit.out`, `build.out`, `days_sim.py`, `days.md`, `r1m_out.txt`). Every
  number below is copied from them._
- _**Checked:** an independent verifier pass audited this file against those sources. Its 2 high and 14 low flags are
  fixed below._
- _**Labels:** [V] measured on our records or code, [L] modelled or inferred, [?] unknown._

## Final check (Sun 12:20): NO CHANGE. The Final config is the best point in its neighbourhood

_Verified by an independent pass: 1 high flag (set C must be named; the full key list is below) and 6 low flags, all fixed._

For the Chief (Lucas: "every last bit").
- **The bar:** recommend a change only if it is positive in ALL worlds at ≥ 3 SE.
- **Result:** no candidate meets it. Play f57a002 with **set C** (the start script's `use C`) plus `{"MIN_STEP_P": 15,
  "ACCEPT_BY": 1, "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.08, "WORTH_FLOOR_SHARE": 0.075}`, as planned.
- **The effective file must hold all of these** (this is what was simulated):
  `{"MIN_STEP_P": 15, "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.08, "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 0, "OPEN_WAIT": 0, "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.25,
  "ACCEPT_BY": 1, "WORTH_FLOOR_SHARE": 0.075}`.
  - The 4 keys alone, on top of the code defaults, would play LATE_SWITCH_LEFT 4 and OPEN_WAIT 2, which was never
    simulated.
  - Approving all 7 is harmless: approve merges.
- **Sources:** scratchpad `final/`: `extract68.py` → `d3rows68.json`, `calib68.out` / `calib68b.out`, `sim4.py`,
  `final_sweep.py` / `final_sweep.out`.

### 1. Duels III, all 68 duels [V]
- **Deals:** 57 of 68 (0.84); 57 of 60 rivals that spoke or accepted (0.95).
- **Rival mix:**
  - 8 silent (12%);
  - 6 only accepted our offer, never sending one (9%, up from 3% at 33 duels);
  - 4 were a Verde-type mirror: 11352/11353, and 11572/11573, which appear as "Rival Oro". The same team is inferred
    from the template and the behaviour [L].
- **The mirror dealt in 3 of 4 duels:** 11572 at +0.89 of our limit, 11573 at +0.22, 11353 at 0, 11352 no deal.
- **Deal shape:** worth per deal 0.25 of our limit; 1.77 rounds per deal; 12 deals worth ≤ 0.06 (3 at 0).
- **Points:** 24.68 over the 67 duels closed by tick 2054 ≈ 0.37 a duel.
- **The field** (feed `duel.closed`, session 4): 457 of 612 duels ended in a deal (0.747).
- **Configs played:** 29 duels on ACCEPT_BY 2 / MAX 0.12, 16 on ACCEPT_BY 1 / MAX 0.12, 23 on ACCEPT_BY 1 / MAX 0.08.
  The refit simulates exactly this config mix (params only, without the last-tick fix, worth ≤ 0.001).

### 2. Refit [L]
- **Method:** a grid over rival toughness, end softening, floors, pie size and concession speed, extended to softer
  floors (`calib68b.out`).
- **Best fit F1:** distance 3.4 over 5 moments, against 5.0 for the old grid's best. F1 matches points (0.39 vs 0.37),
  worth per deal (0.255) and rounds (1.74).
- **Still low:** deal rate with responders (0.91 vs 0.95, 1.4 SE) and near-zero deals (0.15 vs 0.21, 1.1 SE).
- **The 11 worlds:**
  - F1, F1 under H2, F2 (softer floors), F3 (bigger pies, tough);
  - the earlier 33-duel fits D3a and D3c;
  - tiny pies, 20% mirrors, 25% silent + 15% accept-only, 30% fast closers;
  - the Duels II fit R1.
- **The Final config in the 68-duel fits (F1-F3):** 0.37-0.42 a duel; deal rate with responders 0.90-0.92.

### 3. Sweep around the Final config [L]
Paired, 8,000 duels per world (`final_sweep.out`).

| Candidate | Min / max Δ over the 11 worlds | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| ACCEPT_BY 2 (reference) | −0.026 / −0.007, every world ≥ 12 SE worse | keep 1 |
| Floor 0.05 / 0.06 | worse in 10 of 11 worlds (≈ −0.003 to −0.010) | keep 0.075 |
| Floor 0.09 / 0.10 | +0.004 / +0.007 at best; −0.022 / −0.033 with tiny pies | keep 0.075 |
| OPENER_SHARE_SELLER 0.35 | −0.004 (R1) to +0.015 (tiny pies) | no |
| OPENER_SHARE_SELLER 0.50 / 0.60 | never better (≤ 0 everywhere), down to −0.017 / −0.036 | no |
| OPENER_SHARE_BUYER 0.30 / 0.45 | −0.003 to +0.014 / worse everywhere | no |
| END_STEP_SHARE 0.35 / 0.65 | down to −0.014 / mixed, −0.002 to +0.003 | keep 0.5 |
| CODE_STEP_SHARE 0.05 (below MAX 0.08) | +0.001 to +0.007 at ≥ 4 SE in 10 worlds; tiny pies −0.0001 (−0.8 SE) | the only near-miss; below the bar |
| MONO_END_SHARE 0.15 / 0.20 / 0.30 / 0.35 | each worse somewhere (tiny pies, F3, D3c or R1) | keep 0.25 |
| DECIDE_LEFT 2 / 4 / 5 | −0.001 / 0 / 0: the extra decisions are held steps | keep 3 |
| CLOSING_TICKS 2 / 4 (with DECIDE_LEFT) | −0.095 to −0.033 / −0.054 to +0.038 | keep 3 |
| Mirror rule A (code): on a detected Verde, switch to its day at worth-neutral | 0.000 to +0.0003 | no: Verde already deals |
| Mirror rule B (code): on a detected Verde, stop conceding | −0.002 to 0 | no |

- **The near-miss, CODE_STEP_SHARE 0.05:**
  - It holds more mid-duel: a step goes out only once 5% of the gap reaches 15 P.
  - With tiny pies it is ≈ 0 (−0.0001, not significantly negative), so it misses the bar on one world.
  - At ≈ +0.003 a duel × 34 ≈ +0.1 raw, it isn't worth a change.
- **MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.05 does the same.** Both validate: CODE_STEP_SHARE 0.03-0.60, MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.05-0.60, and the
  CROSS rules hold.

### 4. For the Final
- **No change.** Set it between sessions, and never raise the floor mid-session.
- **Expected [L]:** ≈ 0.37-0.42 points a duel on the 68-duel fits, against 0.37 in Duels III.
  - F1 overpredicts Duels III by ≈ 0.02 (0.39 vs 0.37), so ≈ 0.40 is the central estimate: ≈ 13.5 raw over 34
    duels.
  - ± ≈ 1.8 for duel-outcome noise alone (per-duel SD ≈ 0.31 → SE 0.053 a duel). The spread between models comes
    on top.
- **Live, the only thing worth a hot change** is a breakage signal: run the first-wave checklist. Below ≈ 12 duels,
  points can't tell configs apart.

## Pre-Final program (Sun 11:30): one config for the Final, one hot change now

For the Chief (Lucas's request).
- **Labels:** [V] = measured on our records or code; [L] = modelled.
- **Sources:** scratchpad `final/`: `extract.py` → `d3rows.json`, `calib.py` / `calib.out`, `sim4.py`, `program.out`
  to `program5.out`.
- **sim4 = sim3** (the Duels II-validated simulator) plus five additions:
  - a Verde-type mirror rival;
  - the 506a2fd last-tick accept;
  - an optional worth floor on our own offers;
  - `acc_ratio` (ACCEPT_RATIO);
  - `tick_decay` (§4).
  - Its own random-number stream means sim3 numbers don't reproduce exactly. Every comparison here is within sim4.
- **Every comparison is paired:** 8,000 duels per world, 12 ticks, 10% decay, H1 unless stated, ± = 95% CI.

### 1. Today's opponents (Duels III, our 33 closed duels at fit time, 41 now) [V]
- **Silent rivals:** 5 of 33 (15%). 1 more only accepted (3%), and 2 were the Verde mirror (6%):
  - Verde posts at its own day;
  - its price is capped at our latest price (11352, 11353).
- **Deals:**
  - 26 of the 28 rivals that spoke (0.93); 26 of 33 overall (0.79);
  - the rival accepted our offer in 12 deals, we accepted theirs in 14;
  - worth per deal 0.27 of our limit; 1.7 rounds per deal.
- **Near-zero deals:** 8 of 26 deals were worth ≤ 0.06 of our limit, 3 of them at exactly 0.
  - They score ≈ 0: 11240 added +0.04 points, 11242 +0.06.
  - Pies are ≈ 30-40 P from the score increments, so these were tough rivals, not tiny pies [L: inferred].
- **Points:** 10.66 over 33 duels ≈ 0.32 a duel at fit time; now 13.81 over 41 ≈ 0.34 (Duels II: 0.52).
- **The field** (feed `duel.closed`, all teams): Duels III deal rate 0.73 (200 of 275 at 11:20), against our 0.79.
- **Fit [L]:** a grid over rival toughness, end softening, floors, concession speed and pie size, scored on 5 moments
  (`calib.out`).
  - My choice of three distinct fits from the top 8: the best overall (D3a), the best with smaller pies (D3b, 4th) and
    the best tough one (D3c, 7th).
  - They sit within ≈ 1 SE of every moment except near-zero deals (0.14-0.20 simulated vs 0.31 observed). D3b's deal
    rate with responders is 1.4 SE low.
  - The fit plays ACCEPT_BY 2, although Duels III's first ≈ 16-19 duels ran ACCEPT_BY 1.
  - Stress worlds: tiny pies, smaller pies, 20% mirrors, 25% silent plus 10% accept-only, H2, and the Duels II fit
    R1.
- **Rivals rarely retreat [V]:** when an in-limit rival offer stood with 2 ticks left, at 1 tick left it was the same 27
  times, better 4 and worse once (Duels I-III, `retreat.out`).

### 2. Results [L] (`program.out`, `program2.out`, `program3.out`, `program5.out`)

| vs live (MIN_STEP_P 15, ACCEPT_BY 2, 506a2fd fix) | D3a | D3b | D3c | Range over the worlds run (* = 4 worlds: D3a-c and R1; else 8; the last two rows 9) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Live without the fix * | −0.001 | −0.001 | −0.000 | −0.000 to −0.001 |
| ACCEPT_BY 1 | +0.008 | +0.013 | +0.009 | +0.005 to +0.019, all > 4 SE |
| ACCEPT_BY 3 * | −0.014 | −0.020 | −0.017 | negative everywhere |
| MIN_STEP_P 8 / 12 * | −0.008 / −0.003 | −0.020 / −0.008 | −0.034 / −0.008 | 15 (the bound) is best |
| MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.08 (the code step is min(0.12, MAX) × gap) | +0.002 | +0.004 | +0.009 | −0.000 to +0.009 |
| CODE_STEP_SHARE + MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.18 | −0.007 | −0.011 | −0.026 | negative except tiny pies |
| MONO_END_SHARE 0.15 / 0.40 / 0.60 * | 0.000 / −0.012 / −0.026 | −0.001 / −0.009 / −0.027 | +0.001 / −0.021 / −0.041 | 0.25 stays |
| ACCEPT_RATIO 0.9 / 0.8 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | no measurable effect (≤ 0.0002) |
| Worth floor 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.15 × limit (code; 0.15 *) | +0.006 / +0.013 / +0.005 | +0.009 / +0.017 / 0.000 | +0.006 / +0.017 / +0.018 | 0.10 turns −0.007 with tiny pies |
| **Params only: ACCEPT_BY 1 + MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.08** | **+0.010** | **+0.017** | **+0.018** | **+0.008 to +0.019, all > 4 SE** |
| **Recommended: params + floor 0.075 × limit** | **+0.022** | **+0.033** | **+0.029** | **+0.018 to +0.033, all > 9 SE** |
| Aleks's c95b700, exchange mode (proxy, 10% timeouts) * | −0.042 | −0.080 | −0.116 | −0.04 to −0.12 |

- **Deal rate with rivals that spoke:**
  - live: 0.89-0.92 on the D3 fits;
  - recommended: 0.87-0.91, while 0-worth deals go from ≈ 0.03 a duel to 0.
  - The floor trades only near-zero deals for a little deal rate. Floor 0.10 costs more (0.85-0.90).
- **Floor 0.075 × limit is the robust size.** It is positive in all 9 worlds, including tiny pies (+0.003 on top of
  ACCEPT_BY 1) and smaller pies (+0.016). 0.10 scores ≈ +0.001-0.006 more on the D3 fits but turns negative with tiny pies.
- **The 506a2fd fix is worth little in the sim** (+0.0002 to +0.0013): the sim's rival posts before our move inside a
  tick. In the records it cost one deal in 33 (11124).

### 3. Aleks's c95b700 (`--decay-mode exchange`) and how faithful the proxy is
- **What it is [V, code]:** main's LLM duelist.
  - Opus low as strategist, Sonnet low as negotiator, a 12 s decision ceiling and an 8 s strategy budget.
  - The strategist's band authorises acceptance.
  - Today's defaults: MIN_STEP_P 3, MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.25, LATE_SWITCH_LEFT 4, ACCEPT_BY 2, OPEN_WAIT 2.
  - It has no code-first policy, no MONO_END guard and not the 506a2fd fix.
  - Its default `--decay-mode tick` treats silence as costly, which contradicts the verified scoring. Only
    `exchange` matches the game.
- **Proxy:** sim3's "today" policy with today's params:
  - LLM-sized concessions fitted on Duels I-II (validated on Duels II per role within +7 / −3 / +17%);
  - safe_move on 10% or 30% timeouts;
  - break-even band accepts (acc_f 0.9, which changed nothing).
- **Faithfulness: moderate.**
  - The direction is robust: the code policy beat this proxy in every world here, and in the Duels II out-of-sample
    test.
  - The size is uncertain: new prompts (per-tick bands, accept shortcuts), a Sonnet negotiator and the writer fallback
    aren't modelled. Read −0.04 to −0.12 as "clearly worse", ±50%.

### 4. Sensitivity: what if decay applied per TICK? (`program4.out`)
Robustness only: the server data says per exchange.
- **Live would lose ≈ 0.044-0.048 a duel** to the tick-mode proxy (0.040-0.044 to a fast variant) in two worlds, and
  still win in the tough one.
- **The recommended config stays at or above live** in all three (+0.005 to +0.009).

### 5. Recommendation
- **Now (rest of Duels III), hot:** `{"ACCEPT_BY": 1, "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.08}`. Sent at 11:29.
  - ≈ +0.010-0.018 a duel × ≈ 27 duels left ≈ +0.3-0.5 raw.
  - Undo: `{"ACCEPT_BY": 2, "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.12}`.
- **The Final, ONE config:** set C with MIN_STEP_P 15, ACCEPT_BY 1 and MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.08, on 506a2fd, plus a worth
  floor of 0.075 × our limit if the Builder ships it with a test before the restart.
  - ≈ +0.028 a duel on the D3 fits × 34 ≈ +0.95 raw over live. Params only: ≈ +0.5.
  - After the restart's `use C`, re-approve `{"MIN_STEP_P": 15, "ACCEPT_BY": 1, "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.08}`.
- **Floor spec for the Builder:**
  - A new param `WORTH_FLOOR_SHARE` (0-0.3, default 0 = off) in `final()`, the guard every move passes.
  - If an offer's worth to us is below `WORTH_FLOOR_SHARE` × our limit, raise it to that worth at the same day.
  - If that equals our standing offer, hold and send nothing. A repeat would cost a round.
  - Accepts are unchanged: any in-limit standing offer is still taken by the deadline and small-gap rules.
  - The silent walk's floor becomes the larger of the SILENT_KEEP floor and this floor.
  - Test: a code end step that would land at 0 worth lands at the floor; an accept of a +1 offer still goes out.
- **Not recommended:**
  - LATE_SWITCH_LEFT 2 (11:14, `v2/ls2.out`: −0.005 to −0.015);
  - MONO_END_SHARE above 0.25 (raises the close rate only by adding 0-worth deals: 0.06-0.12 a duel);
  - MIN_STEP_P below 15;
  - ACCEPT_BY 3;
  - c95b700, in either mode.
- **Caveats [L]:**
  - Every number is modelled. Live data can't resolve 0.01 a duel: the SE is ≈ 0.05 over 34 duels.
  - The floor touches only near-zero deals where the rival accepted OUR offer: 4 of the 8 (11125, 11285 and 11353 at
    0; 11241 at +0.06, which a floor could lose).
  - The other 4 were our accepts of their offers, which the floor leaves alone.
  - The floor's real risk is a scenario where the rival's limit sits within 0.075 × our limit of ours. That is the
    tiny-pie world, where the floor still gained +0.003.

## C+ verdict (Sun 07:35): YES, play C+ (C plus MIN_STEP_P 15 and ACCEPT_BY 1), applied hot on 29aa1be

This answers the Chief's 08:15 question on `intel/contra-duels.md` §1. An independent verifier audited this section
(1 code claim and 3 instructions corrected below).
- **It supersedes** "`ACCEPT_BY` 1: settle risk" under "Still not recommended" in the FINAL section (Sat 23:45). That
  risk is now bounded below.
- **Setup [L]:** re-run on my sim3, paired against C. 12 ticks, 10% decay, code-first with the branch's openers
  (0.42 / 0.37). 10,000 duels per world, 95% CIs.
- **Mirrors** use the models' drawn openers.
- **Sources:** scratchpad `v2/cplus.py` and `cplus.out`; LLM moves in `cplus_llm.out`; accept slips in
  `accslip.out`.

| World (H1) | C, points per duel | C+ − C | Deal rate C → C+ |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1-R5, past rivals | 0.37-0.48 | +0.022 to +0.029 (± 0.003) | unchanged or +0.01 |
| Fast closer | 0.345 | +0.041 ± 0.003 | 0.89 → 0.90 |
| 20% silent rivals | 0.388 | +0.021 ± 0.003 | 0.75 → 0.76 |
| Tough all duel / no end-softening (the worst two) | 0.265 / 0.334 | +0.006 ± 0.002 / +0.007 ± 0.003 | 0.78 → 0.79 / 0.83 → 0.84 |
| All replies tough / high floors / small pies | 0.32-0.47 | +0.022 / +0.029 / +0.049 | +0.01 to +0.03 |
| Mirrors: our bot plays C+ instead of C, against today / A / C / C+ | 0.28-0.39 | +0.117 / +0.026 / +0.112 / +0.078 | against A: 1.00 → 0.95 |

- **H2 agrees:** C+ − C is between +0.008 and +0.035 in every world.
- **Under LLM moves** (only if the code policy is pulled), the gain is smaller and the deal rate drops 0.01-0.03:
  - realistic worlds: +0.012 to +0.025;
  - with 30% timeouts: +0.006 to +0.010;
  - the two extreme worlds: ≈ −0.002.
- **The one significantly negative cell:** LLM moves with 30% timeouts and no end-softening, −0.0022 ± 0.0020.
  - It is tiny and needs the code policy pulled.
  - One marginal hit in ≈ 36 cells is what chance alone gives.
  - Every code-first cell is positive.
- **Apply both changes or neither:**
  - `MIN_STEP_P` 15 alone carries ≈ 63% of the gain (+0.018 of +0.028). It is the variant that turns slightly
    negative when rivals are tough all duel (−0.0035 ± 0.0021).
  - `ACCEPT_BY` 1 alone gains +0.006 to +0.032.
  - Together they are positive in every code-first world.
  - A middle option, `MIN_STEP_P` 12 with `ACCEPT_BY` 1, scores at or below C+: no reason to pick it.
- **Stake [L]:** past rivals plus the fast closer, H1, code-first:
  - ≈ +0.028 a duel, which matches contra-duels' +0.029;
  - × 102 Sunday duels (68 in Duels III, 34 in the Final) ≈ **+2.9 raw duel points**;
  - ≈ +0.45 Sunday points at contra-duels' 1 raw ≈ 0.16.
- **Rounds per deal:** C+ runs ≈ 0.2-0.3 fewer rounds per deal than C in the sim, except against the fast closer
  (+0.3).
  - Live C ran above the sim (2-3), so judge C+ live against C, not against the sim's absolute numbers.
- **`MIN_STEP_P` 15 is the top of its bound** (0-15 in `params.py` SPEC) [V]. The tough-world result argues against
  pushing it further.

**The risk the sim doesn't see: `ACCEPT_BY` 1 has no spare tick.** An accept refused on the last tick isn't retried,
so the deal is lost.
- **Facts [V]:**
  - duel accepts aren't limited per team (organisers, Sat 16:55; three settled in tick 1281);
  - our only two accepts sent with 1 tick left (2506, 6095) were both queued and settled;
  - none of our accepts was ever refused: the 5 send errors on record are 3 `wait_for_tick` and 2 `bad_price`, all on
    offers;
  - the deadline accept takes no model call.
- **The busy key** (Chief, 07:20: the trader, swaps and opps on, the key at 73-92%). Simulated [L]: each accept slips
  a tick with probability p. A slipped accept is retried next tick; with 1 tick left the deal is lost
  (`v2/accslip.out`):

  | p | C+ − C | `MIN_STEP_P` 15 alone − C | C+ − (15 alone) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 0 | +0.028 | +0.018 | +0.010 |
  | 5% | +0.027 | +0.018 | +0.009 |
  | 20% | +0.024 | +0.018 | +0.006 |

- **Records bound [L]:** the sim under-counts late accepts.
  - In our records, 21-24% of duels closed on our accept with ≤ 2 ticks left (Duels I 8/34, Duels II 14/68), all at
    `ACCEPT_BY` 2. C+ holds longer, so its share is likely higher.
  - A slip rate p then costs ≈ p × 0.22 × ≈ 0.5 (simulated points per deal) ≈ 0.11·p a duel, or more.
  - Break-even against `MIN_STEP_P` 15 alone: **p ≈ 9%** of last-tick accepts, lower if the share is higher.
  - Break-even against C: **p ≈ 25%**.
- **What p is plausible:** ops-contention gives ≤ 0.6% of the duelist's moves pushed a tick in Duels III with
  everything on.
  - Its caveats: the server's limiter may be stricter than a plain bucket.
  - Wave-synchronised last-tick accepts land in the tick-start burst, where that model refuses some duelist moves for
    4-5 s.
  - So p is probably far below 9%, but it is unmeasured [?].
- **Verdict on the trader:** C+ still wins with the trader, swaps and opps on.
  - Keep them off in the duel window anyway (directives 01:30, contra-duels §5). The hedge costs ≈ nothing (the trader
    took 2 accepts all Saturday) and removes this tail.
  - If they must run, C+ is still better than `MIN_STEP_P` 15 alone unless more than ≈ 1 in 11 last-tick accepts
    slips.
  - If any accept shows a send error, set `ACCEPT_BY` back to 2 (`approve` with `{"ACCEPT_BY": 2}`).

**How to apply.**
- **Recommended: hot, on the already-checked 29aa1be.** No new sha, no test change.
  - Dry-run on a scratch copy of 29aa1be, 07:28 [V]: `use C` → `approve` exits 0, giving `MIN_STEP_P` 8 → 15 and
    `ACCEPT_BY` default 2 → 1, with `_set` still "C".
  - `params.validate()` is clean.
  - `use A` writes A whole, which puts `ACCEPT_BY` back to 2. The C → A auto-switch therefore still works.
  - After the start at 08:00, in `$WT`:
    ```bash
    printf '{"wave": "C+ Duel Lab", "params": {"MIN_STEP_P": 15, "ACCEPT_BY": 1}}\n' > "$WT/run/c_plus.json"
    (cd "$WT" && python3 tools/duel_loop.py approve --proposal run/c_plus.json --by Aleks)
    ```
  - Expect `MIN_STEP_P: 8.0 → 15` and `ACCEPT_BY: default 2 → 1`. The next tick's supervise log shows the
    `params:` lines.
  - **Every re-run of the start script reinstalls plain C** (its step 4/6 is `use C`, checked in the dry run). Re-run
    the two lines after any restart.
- **Alternative: a new sha with a "C+" set.** It needs three edits and a re-check before 08:00 (read on 29aa1be [V]):
  1. **`docs/duel_sets.json`:** add `"C+"` and give every other set `ACCEPT_BY` 2:
     ```json
     "C+":    {"MIN_STEP_P": 15, "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.12, "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 0, "OPEN_WAIT": 0, "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.25, "ACCEPT_BY": 1},
     "C":     {"MIN_STEP_P": 8,  "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.12, "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 0, "OPEN_WAIT": 0, "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.25, "ACCEPT_BY": 2},
     "A":     {"MIN_STEP_P": 5,  "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.18, "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 2, "OPEN_WAIT": 2, "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.25, "ACCEPT_BY": 2},
     "today": {"MIN_STEP_P": 3,  "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.25, "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 4, "OPEN_WAIT": 2, "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.25, "ACCEPT_BY": 2},
     "_switch": {"C": "A", "C+": "A"}
     ```
     - Without `ACCEPT_BY` in every set, `load_sets` rejects the file (its sets list different keys).
     - Without `"C+": "A"`, the auto-switch logs "plays C+ … nothing written".
  2. **`tests/test_duel_loop.py:497-499`** (`test_the_repo_sets_file_is_valid_and_its_sets_list_the_same_keys`)
     asserts `set(sets) == {"today", "A", "C"}` and `switch == {"C": "A"}`. Update it.
     - Otherwise the start script's step 3/6 (the full test suite) stops with "tests red: not starting".
  3. **Start with `SET=C+`.** The script defaults to `SET=C`, and `_default` only plays when the params file is
     missing. The same goes for any restart line, including the `--days-read flip` one.

## Morning check (Sun 06:45): GO as written

- **Branch `origin/duelist-loop` 29aa1be [V code]:**
  - `OPENER_SHARE_SELLER` 0.42 (price), `OPENER_SHARE_BUYER` 0.37;
  - `docs/duel_sets.json`: `_switch` {"C": "A"} only, `_default` "A";
  - sets C, A and today pass `params.validate()`;
  - `GUARDS` 1; the S1 and prompt fixes are in;
  - `duelist_sunday.sh` defaults to `SET=C`, `POLICY=code`, `FLAGS="--model claude-opus-5-5 --effort low
    --negotiator-model claude-haiku-4-5 --failover-s 8"`, `AUTOSWITCH=0`.
- **`/api/schedule` at 06:45 [V]:**
  - Sunday opens at hour 16.65 with 15 s ticks;
  - **Duels III at 18.65:** 12 ticks, 10% decay, 4 at once, rounds 2 (68 duels);
  - **the Final at 21.65:** the same settings, rounds 1 (34 duels);
  - unchanged from Saturday night.
- **To run at 08:00:** `AUTOSWITCH=1 COMMIT=29aa1be bash <(git show origin/duelist-loop:tools/duelist_sunday.sh)`.
  `AUTOSWITCH` must be passed: the script's default is 0. Pin `COMMIT` to the sha the re-audit approves.
- **Expected [L], with the branch's exact openers:** code-first C 0.428 points per duel against today's LLM setup
  with ≈ 30% timeouts at 0.341, ≈ +0.087 per duel. Over Duels III that's ≈ +5.9 duel points (past rivals + the fast
  closer, H1; `v2/opener_code.out`, `codefirst2.out`).
- **Live checks after the first two waves** (`python3 tools/duel_gates.py --session 4 --params
  <WT>/run/duel_params.json`):
  - deal rate with rivals that spoke ≈ 0.88-0.93 expected; < 0.60 over ≥ 12 → the switch to A;
  - ≈ 2-3 rounds per deal (C's simulated range 1.7-2.4, past + fast);
  - under C+, expect ≈ 0.2-0.3 fewer rounds per deal than C ran, and more deals closed on the last tick;
  - no `CAN'T READ` on the day line.
- **First-wave checklist for Aleks** (≈ 3 min into Duels III, and again at the Final; contra-duels §2-§3):
  1. Every days duel's day line names a direction. This prints nothing:
     `grep -E "direction unknown|CAN'T READ|refused" <newest $WT/logs/duelist/supervise-*.log>`.
  2. For the first deal, `pred` equals `points` in `uv run python -m agents.duelist review` (run it from the
     checkout).
  3. No `refused:` lines (a new issue).
  4. At least one of the first four rivals that spoke reached a deal.
  - **If check 1 or 2 fails because the reading is reversed:** run contra-duels §2's `--stop`, then its restart line
    with `--days-read flip`. It starts `SET=C` on `$SHA` (29aa1be).
    - **Then re-run the two C+ lines** (`printf` and `approve`): the restart reinstalls plain C.
    - On a new-sha "C+" set, use `SET=C+` in the restart line instead.
  - **"Direction unknown":** it needs a code fix; tell Lucas.
  - **Anything else:** use contra-duels §3's tiers:
    - `use A` when the set is too stiff;
    - `POLICY=llm SET=A` when the code policy misbehaves;
    - `--rollback` with `OLD_FLAGS` when the branch is broken.
  - **A SWITCH line:** run the four checks before believing it.

## SUNDAY v2 (Sun 01:10): the 08:00 recommendation for Duels III and the Final

_Chief's overnight program v2, analysis only (no game writes, nothing on main's `agents/duelist/`)._
- _**Setting:** 12 ticks, 10% decay, 4 at once._
- _**Simulator:** `v2/sim3.py` = the role-aware days simulator (calibrated on Duels II) + a fast-closer rival + a
  mirror engine (our logic on both sides) + timeouts as `agent.safe_move` plays them + `--policy code` as coded._
- _**Units:** points per duel = share × 0.9^rounds (H1; H2 agrees). Results are modelled [L] unless marked [V]._
- _**Inputs folded in:** the duelist audit (`intel/duelist-audit.md`) and three verifier passes on this section._
- _**Files:** scratchpad `v2/`; the param sets are in the repo under `intel/duel-sets/`._

### The 08:00 recommendation (aligned with `origin/duelist-loop` 3a0f6f3)

The branch already contains:
- **the audit's S1 fix:** the code policy's give is worth-neutral (`policy.py` l.77-78);
- **the prompt fix:** no late-switch line when `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` is 0, and no tick count otherwise (`agent.py`
  `late_switch_line`);
- **the approved sets:** `docs/duel_sets.json` holds C, A and today, with the same five keys each;
- **`duel_loop.py use SET`:** writes one set as the whole params file;
- **`duel_loop.py switch`:** this rule, once per set, never back;
- **`tools/duelist_sunday.sh`:** starts the approved commit in its own worktree.

**C2 is no longer needed.**

| | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Run** | `bash <(git show origin/duelist-loop:tools/duelist_sunday.sh)` with its defaults: `SET=C`, `POLICY=code`, `FLAGS="--model claude-opus-5-5 --effort low --negotiator-model claude-haiku-4-5 --failover-s 8"`. Pin `COMMIT` to the sha the re-audit approves |
| **Param set** | **C** = `MIN_STEP_P` 8, `MAX_STEP_SHARE` 0.12, `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 0, `OPEN_WAIT` 0, `MONO_END_SHARE` 0.25 |
| **Policy** | **code** (code decides, Haiku writes the words). **If it misbehaves live, the tested way back is `--rollback`:** it stops every duelist and starts Saturday's (main, LLM policy, Saturday's constants). The script has no stop-only mode, so switching to `POLICY=llm` mid-session means stopping the running duelist first and re-running with `SET=<the set now live>`. A plain re-run reinstalls `SET` (default C) and, after a switch, would bring C back with the rule spent. Ask the Builder for a `--stop` if you want this path |
| **Switch rule** | `AUTOSWITCH=1`, with the only step C → A. Today's defaults score below A in every simulated group, so a second step (A → today) can only cost. **How:** the Builder pushes a commit to duelist-loop that removes `"A": "today"` from `_switch` in `docs/duel_sets.json`, and Aleks pins `COMMIT` to that sha. Don't edit `$WT` by hand: the script aborts on local changes. **Fallback if that commit isn't there:** once A is live, `touch $WT/run/duel_switch.off` (the switch's kill switch). The rule: ≥ 12 closed duels with a rival that spoke, deal rate < 0.60 → `use A`, once per set, never back. **A loop tweak approved mid-session doesn't block the switch** (it reads the file's `_set`), **but a switch to A overwrites it** |
| **If C is rejected** | `SET=A`, with `AUTOSWITCH=0` (no lower set worth switching to) |
| **`_default`** | Keep `"A"`. It plays only if `run/duel_params.json` goes missing; A is the safer fallback |
| **The Final** | Session 5 (Duels III is session 4; `docs/duels/feed.jsonl` `duels.scheduled`; confirm at the start). Start on the set Duels III ended on; the rule's count restarts. The switch was simulated over 68-duel sessions; over the Final's 34 it fires even less often |

_`intel/duel-sets/*.json` (main) hold the same values in `approve`'s proposal format; the branch's
`docs/duel_sets.json` + `use` supersede them._

**Ruling on the code opener (Sun 02:00, for the final sha; `v2/opener_code.out`) [L]:**
- **The branch's `OPENER_SHARE_SELLER` 0.73 (a99f641) is not equivalent to 0.42.** `policy.py` applies it as a
  **price** distance above the limit on our best day, so with the seller's day bonus a median seller opens at ≈ 1.0 ×
  the limit in worth. 0.73 is the models' median in **worth**; in price their median is ≈ 0.63.
- **Use `OPENER_SHARE_SELLER = 0.42` (price units, as the code reads it). Keep `OPENER_SHARE_BUYER = 0.37`:** a buyer's
  best day (0) has no day cost, so price and worth agree.
- **Set C, code-first, 12 ticks / 10%, past rivals + the fast closer, 10,000 duels per world, paired against a99f641
  as is:**
  - **Seller 0.42: +0.026 ± 0.001 per duel** (H1; H2 +0.025), ≈ +1.8 points over Duels III;
  - **The curve:** seller 0.30 ≈ 0.42 (H1 +0.026, H2 +0.029), then 0.50 +0.020, 0.63 +0.008, 0.85 −0.008.
  - **Buyer:** 0.30 would add +0.006 more (model-dependent: our openers are drawn independently of the pie), 0.42
    loses. Keep 0.37.
- **The re-audit's patch item 3 (seller 0.42) is right.**

**Expected points per duel at 12 ticks / 10%** (past rivals in 5 role-aware worlds + the fast closer;
`codefirst2.out`):

| Set | Code-first (S1 fixed) | LLM moves, no timeouts | LLM moves, 30% timeouts (audit: 30% of Duels II decisions > 10 s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Today | 0.368 (deal 0.899) | 0.346 (0.876) | 0.341 (0.897) |
| A | 0.396 (0.895) | 0.381 (0.880) | 0.368 (0.911) |
| **C** | **0.421** (0.878; seller 0.529, buyer 0.315) | 0.401 (0.845) | 0.387 (0.896) |
| C2 | 0.414 (0.850) | 0.390 (0.814) | 0.384 (0.885) |

- **Code-first C vs today's LLM run with 30% timeouts:** +0.080 per duel ≈ **+5.4 duel points over Duels III, +2.7
  in the Final** [L].
- **Code-first C (code decides, so no model timeouts) vs LLM C with 30% timeouts:** 0.421 vs 0.387, +0.034 per duel.
  The sim used 31% (0.307), the measured rate.

### Why C: robustness across opponents [L] (`robust2.out`, `summary_table.out`, LLM moves)

| Set | Past rivals | Fast closer | Mirrors (G, A, C) | Extreme (5) | Worst cell |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Today | 0.355 (deal 0.870) | 0.304 (0.898) | 0.273 (0.884) | 0.303 (0.836) | 0.237 |
| A | 0.392 (0.878) | 0.327 (0.892) | 0.291 (0.968) | 0.326 (0.819) | 0.241 |
| **C** | **0.415** (0.839) | **0.329** (0.876) | **0.353** (0.964) | **0.337** (0.766) | 0.239 |

- **C is best in every group under both scoring readings,** and is the best single config in a 36-config grid
  (`adapt.out`; C sits on the grid's corner, so more extreme values were not tested).
- **Its deal rate per group:** −3 points against past rivals, −2 against the fast closer, +8 against mirrors, **−7 in
  the extreme worlds** (0.71 where rivals are tough all duel).
- **Where its edge over today comes from (past rivals):**
  - today → A: +0.037;
  - the 8 P floor with the 0.12 cap: +0.005;
  - late switch off + `OPEN_WAIT` 0: +0.018.
- **Against mirrors, the hold carries the edge.**
- **The evidence risk (audit):** the new settings would change or hold back the closing offers of 12 of the 56 Duels
  II deals (measured at the earlier, gentler file; C holds more). C's gain rests on the simulator's view that those
  rivals take a later offer.

### Quality checks

- **Out of sample, partly (`oos.out`).** A split within Duels II.
  - **Refit on the first half (31 duels):** limits, openers and day weights by role, and the M / tau / conc
    calibration.
  - **Not refit:** the rival mixes (fitted on the first 35 closed duels, mostly but not only the first half), the
    Duels I + II pie ratios and the last-tick steps (some leakage).
  - **What it tests:** today's LLM policy at 16 ticks / 8%, not C or A at 12 / 10%. Predicting the second half (31):
  - **All duels:** result 19.1 vs 16.1 P per duel (+18%, inside the actual's 95% CI of 10.5-21.8). Sellers are
    over-predicted by 32% (27.5 vs 20.8 P), buyers are on target (12.1 vs 12.3). **Deal rate 0.94 vs 0.77: poor**
    (outside its CI of 0.61-0.90).
  - **The cause:** 5 of the second half's 7 no-deals were rivals that never sent a message (16% of duels vs the
    model's 3%). The others were a one-shot rival offering exactly our limit and a day standoff with no overlap.
  - **On the duels where the rival spoke (25; computed by a follow-up run appended to `oos.out`):** result 20.3 vs
    19.8 P (+3%, actual CI 14.0-26.0), deal rate 0.969 vs 0.920 (CI 0.80-1.00).
  - **So the bargaining model is not rejected out of sample** (a weak test at n = 25, with some leakage). What it
    got clearly wrong is the share of silent rivals, which score 0 under any set and which the switch rule ignores.
- **Per-opponent adaptation (`adapt.out`).** Knowing each rival's profile at duel start (price kind, accept-threshold
  band, concession band, day behaviour: 120 profiles) and playing the best of 36 configs for it, chosen on one seed
  set and scored on a held-out set:
  - **+0.0014 per duel, 95% CI [+0.0001, +0.0027], ≈ +0.1 points over Duels III.**
  - In-sample it looks like +0.0056: winner's curse.
  - **Not worth building.**
- **Team-10-style fast closer [V records / L model].**
  - **Fitted from:** Team 10's duels can't be identified (aliases change, the feed has no team). The 26 of 82 Duels I+II
    deals that closed within 2 rounds settled at a median 0.48 between the openers, and their first two moves conceded a
    median 0.18 of the opening gap (`fastclosers.out`).
  - **The model** (hand-set, not fitted; its first two replies concede about 40% of the gap, more generous than the
    data's median):
    - it opens at no more than 0.9-1.4 × the pie;
    - it jumps 60% of the way to the openers' midpoint, then halves the remaining distance per reply;
    - it accepts within 10% of the pie of the midpoint, and above its floor in the last 3 ticks;
    - about 61% copy our day.
- **Mirrors (our bot vs our bot).**
  - Everyone on the 22:41 file (`MONO_END_SHARE` 0.5): 0.324; everyone on today's settings: 0.273.
  - The 0.5 file against a today-mirror: 0.238. That's why `MONO_END_SHARE` is 0.25 in every set.
  - C is the best set in every mirror pairing tested (0.305-0.419).
  - Our bot always sits in seat A, whose accept is checked first in a tick. The comparisons are like-for-like; the seat
    effect on absolute levels isn't measured.
- **Fast close as a set (B).** Variants B1-B3 (smaller floor, bigger cap, accept earlier, softer opener) score below A
  and C on average in every group. B wins only where rivals never soften (B2: 0.320 vs C 0.304), and B3 has a slightly
  better worst cell (0.244 vs A 0.241, C 0.239). Expressed in the LLM policy's own params,
  even that edge disappears (`setB_expr.out`). **No B set in the plan.**

### Latency at 15 s ticks [L]

- **Deals lost to a missed tick: 0, under stated assumptions.**
  - The assumptions: a decision starts 0-4 s into the tick, the runner's timeout is max(8, 15 − 5) = 10 s, and sending
    takes 0.5 s, so the latest finish is 14.5 s.
  - A rival message that arrives late in a tick can push our answer into the next tick: a delay, not a lost deal.
  - Deadline accepts are code.
- **The real cost is timeouts.** `safe_move` concedes min(0.5, 1/max(left − 1, 2)) of the gap and is never held, which
  erodes C's hold the most: C 0.401 → 0.387 at 30% timeouts.
- **The code policy's 0.42 opener is fine.** It's a price distance on our best day, so a median seller's day bonus
  takes it to ≈ 0.70 × limit in worth, close to the LLM's 0.73.
  - The audit's "per-role openers" item cites my earlier units error, now retracted.
  - The audit's S1 runaway bug is real and separate: the code-first numbers above assume it's fixed.

### The switch rule: what 4-12 duels can tell [L] (`switch_final.out`, `switch_grid.out`)

- **Points can't choose between sets within a session.** Per-duel points SD 0.31 (world R1), so the standard error is
  0.16 over 4 duels and 0.11 over 8, while the sets differ by about 0.02-0.06 per duel (up to 0.08 against mirrors).
- **Only a collapse of the deal rate is visible.** Whole-session simulation (68 duels in waves of 4, LLM moves, no
  timeouts), Δ = points per 68-duel session against always-C:

  | Rule | Benign: Δ / P(switch) | Tough: Δ / P(switch) | EV at 80% benign / 20% tough |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | C → A if deal rate < 0.75 over ≥ 8 | −0.11 / 12% | +0.14 / 79% | −0.06 |
  | **C → A if deal rate < 0.60 over ≥ 12** | −0.00 / 1% | +0.02 / 18% | +0.00 |

- **It's insurance against a wrong model, not an optimiser.** Even in the tough worlds, always-A beats always-C by only
  ≈ 0.2 points per session, so that is the most it can pay. It almost never fires against the rivals we've seen.
- **The switch simulation itself** used LLM moves without timeouts, not code-first; its relative conclusions are
  assumed to carry over.
- **Mechanics (audit):**
  - a change applies to duels already running at their next decision;
  - there's no quiet moment between waves;
  - `approve` merges, so every set lists the same five keys (A replaces C completely; tested on a scratch params file);
  - the prompt must not state `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` (otherwise C2, where it's 2 in both sets).
- **"Once":** `duel_loop.py switch` applies each `_switch` entry once and never back. `tools/duel_gates.py` only advises
  (run by hand with `--params`, it prints `DONE` once A is live).
- **The old gate is retired.** `tools/duel_loop.py` at 3a0f6f3 calls `dg.rule`. Main's `tools/duel_gates.py` also
  keeps `gates()` / `TODAY_MIN_STEP_P` for older copies; `gates()` now proposes no `MIN_STEP_P` change (the old gate
  had EV −0.06).
- **Auto-apply is built** (duelist-loop 3a0f6f3: `duel_loop.py switch`, started by `duelist_sunday.sh` when
  `AUTOSWITCH=1`).
  It applies `_switch` once per set and never back, so the A → today entry must go for a single C → A step.

## FINAL for Sunday (overnight program, Sat 23:45): Duels III (≈ 11:00) and the Final (≈ 14:00)

_Both sessions: 12 ticks, 10% decay, 4 at once, price + day (`/api/schedule` at 22:08). Duels III: 68 duels; the
Final: 34._
- _**Basis:** a code-only simulator, role-aware and calibrated on the 62 post-fix Duels II duels (checkpoint 2), plus
  exact replays of the records. Outputs in the scratchpad `night/`._
- _**Scope:** no LLM spend, no game writes._
- _**Checked:** two independent verifier passes; every flag is applied here._
- _The checkpoints below are history; this section supersedes them where they differ._

### Do this (one decision, two ways to ship it)

| Path | What | Expected vs main today [L] (`nomerge.py` / `.out`) |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Merge `duelist-loop` (head b10f9cc: the guards are abd0301, `GUARDS` defaults to 1 = on) and write the params file** | the three guards (accept instead of offering worse; worth-monotonic steps; the day call on the first offer) + the file below | **+0.038 to +0.040 per duel** (H2 / H1; worst world +0.034) ≈ **+2.6 to +2.7 points over Duels III, +1.3 in the Final** |
| B. No merge: edit three constants on main | `agent.py`: `MIN_STEP_P` 3→5 (l.50), `MAX_STEP_SHARE` 0.25→0.18 (l.52), `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 4→2 (l.54) | +0.032 to +0.034 per duel (worst world +0.027) ≈ +2.2 points. Also positive in 8 extreme worlds and with reciprocity 0.5: worst +0.003 ± 0.002, rivals that never soften (`gaps.out`) |

`run/duel_params.json` for path A. It passes `params.validate()` on b10f9cc with no errors, and the cross-check
`MIN_STEP_SHARE` 0.05 ≤ 0.18 holds:

```json
{
 "_note": "Duel Lab, Sat 23:45, for Duels III / Final (12 ticks, 10% decay). Role-aware simulator calibrated on 62 Duels II duels: vs main today +0.039/duel (path A: this file + the guards), robust in 5 worlds x 2 scorings x 2 reciprocity levels and 12 extreme worlds. MONO_END_SHARE 0.5 ties 0.25 and beats off. Evidence: intel/duel-lab.md FINAL. Aleks approves before it goes live.",
 "MIN_STEP_P": 5,
 "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.18,
 "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 2,
 "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.5
}
```

**What it does [L]:**
- **The late day-switch moves from 4 ticks left to 2.** This is the largest single piece: +0.018 to +0.021 alone. The
  live switch fires whenever the days differ; the model's switch fires without the code's `dv.sure` check, so this
  piece may be a little overstated.
- **`MIN_STEP_P` 5 with an 18% cap** stops mid-duel concessions while the gap is under ~28 P; the last 3 ticks and the
  deadline accept close those duels. It's worth +0.006 to +0.008 alone. That part works through the hold: sending a 5 P
  step instead scores ≈ 0 (role-blind model, `final5.out`).
- **`MONO_END_SHARE` 0.5** caps the last-ticks concession: a tie with 0.25, and better than off.

**Robustness [L]:**
- **Against the guarded baseline (path A's alternative):** +0.036 to +0.039 in every one of 5 role-aware worlds × 2
  scoring readings × 2 reciprocity levels; worst world +0.030 (`final_role.out`).
- **In 12 extreme worlds:** never below +0.007 (rivals that never soften at the deadline); 0 against all accept-only
  rivals (`robust_extreme.out`).
- **Deal rate:** rises, or is unchanged against accept-only rivals.
- **Against main today:** +0.033 to +0.040 in all 5 role-aware worlds (`nomerge.out`).

### Live gates (`tools/duel_gates.py`: advisory, never writes)

- **Expected under the file** (`file_expect.out`): deal rate ≈ 0.93-0.95 with rivals that speak, ≈ 3.0 rounds per
  deal. The guarded baseline gives ≈ 0.89-0.92 and 3.6-4.0.
- **Judge on two waves, not one:** a single no-deal in a wave of 4 reads 0.75. Gates apply from 8 closed duels with a
  rival that spoke:
  - **Revert `MIN_STEP_P` to 3** if the deal rate is below 0.75 (with 8 duels, 5 deals or fewer). The false-alarm chance
    is 3.8% if the true rate is 0.90, 7.4% at 0.87.
  - **Step `MIN_STEP_P` to 6** if rounds per deal > 3.5 over ≥ 6 deals with a deal rate ≥ 0.85. The model gives 6 a
    further +0.004 to +0.005 per duel in every cell, but it's further from anything played.
- **How the gates work:** the script reads the flat params file and prints a flat diff. **Applying it is
  `tools/duel_loop.py approve`** (the Builder's tool, the only writer), on Aleks's call; every other key stays.
- **Also check:**
  - no concession over 18% of the gap mid-duel;
  - day reading ≠ CAN'T READ;
  - `pred` = `points`.

**For the Builder: the live loop's simulator is outdated.** `tools/duel_sim.py` on duelist-loop is my Saturday 15:50
copy: price-only, role-blind, Duels I. The current role-aware days simulator is now `tools/duel_sim_v2.py` on main:
- self-contained, with the same output as `night/sim2.py`;
- `POLICY_KEYS` maps the params names to its keys (they differ from v1);
- use the `RW` worlds.

Until `duel_loop.py` switches to it, its simulated gains don't model days or roles.

### Answers to the backlog

1. **Per-cluster overrides: not worth building [L]** (`cluster_oracle_v2.out`).
   - With the rival type known from the start (an oracle), the best settings per cluster are nearly one global set:
     `MIN_STEP_P` 8, cap 0.12, late switch off, `OPEN_WAIT` 0. The exception is rivals locked on their own best day,
     which prefer `OPEN_WAIT` 2, and you can only tell them apart by waiting.
   - So the oracle's +0.017 per duel (an in-sample maximum, biased up) is mostly that global set, not specialisation.
     Run as one policy (`gaps.out`), it beats the params file by **+0.016 to +0.019 per duel** (worst world +0.010):
     ≈ +1.2 points more over Duels III, in the model.
   - It holds every mid-duel step under a ~67 P gap, far from anything played, and its `OPEN_WAIT` 0 part is the one
     the models disagree on. Move toward it only through the gates (`MIN_STEP_P` 5 → 6 → 8 if two-wave data agree).
2. **The opener: keep the LLM's [L].**
   - Scaling it per role is mixed: H1 −0.006 to +0.002 for ×0.7-0.85; H2 sellers +0.005 to +0.006; ×1.15 and ×1.3 lose
     everywhere (`opener_role.out`).
   - A fixed code opener scores +0.015 in the model for sellers, but our real seller openers track the pie: corr 0.88,
     n = 7, about 0.4 without the 6094 outlier (`opener_vs_pie.out`). The model treats the opener as noise, so that
     gain is suspect. Buyers: corr 0.25, and fixed openers are within ±0.005.
3. **Robustness:** see above. No world tested shows a loss against today or against the guarded baseline.
4. **The Final:** same 12 ticks / 10% / 4 at once, 34 duels (one per team and role). Same file. The live gates get
   fewer duels to judge (~9 waves vs ~17).
5. **Independent verification:** done twice on this section; every flag applied.

**Still not recommended:**
- `OPEN_WAIT` 0: +0.005 to +0.008 in the model, but the models conflict on what seeing their day first is worth.
- `ACCEPT_BY` 1: settle risk on 15 s ticks.
- Thin-margin accept rules: ±1% on exact replays.
- Break-even / fast-close accepts: −9% to −49% on exact replays (`lab2/`).

## Overnight program, checkpoint 2 (Sat 23:35): role-aware model; the params file stands

**A structural fix to the simulator, and all decisions re-run (`night/final_role.out`).**
- **The flaw.** Until 23:00 the simulator drew our limit, our opener, the money pie and the day weights the same way for
  both roles.
- **Why it matters.** The records differ by role (`byrole.out`):
  - sellers: median limit 78, opener 0.73 × limit, pie 0.48 × limit, weight 2.16 P/day;
  - buyers: median limit 98, opener 0.37 × limit, pie 0.33 × limit, weight 3.68 P/day.
  - A buyer's worth is capped by its limit; a seller's isn't. This is why the earlier "fixed opener 0.55 × limit" looked
    good: it was a role-mixing artefact.
- **Recalibrated per role** (`calib4.out`): deal rate, rounds and result per limit within about ±10% per role (deal
  rate up to +9% high).
- **Re-validated on all 62 post-fix Duels II duels** (`validate3.out`):
  - predicted total result +10% / +7% / +17% (R1 / R2 / R3; sellers over-predicted by 15-25%, buyers within 0-12%);
  - the actual result falls inside the simulated 10-90% band in 51-53 of 62 duels (≈ the expected 80%).

**Decisions on the role-aware model.** 12 ticks / 10%, 5 role-aware worlds, 15,000 duels each, 4 cells (reciprocity 0 or
0.5 × both scoring readings). Baseline = what Aleks runs if the duelist-loop guards merge: live constants + guards +
`MONO_END_SHARE` 0.25.

| Set | Δ per duel (range over the 4 cells) | Worst world | Over 68 duels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The params file** (`MIN_STEP_P` 5, `MAX_STEP_SHARE` 0.18, `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 2, `MONO_END_SHARE` 0.5) | **+0.036 to +0.039** | ≥ +0.030 | **+2.4 to +2.7** |
| file, but `MIN_STEP_P` 6 | +0.040 to +0.043 | ≥ +0.033 | +2.7 to +2.9 |
| file, but `MIN_STEP_P` 8 | +0.043 to +0.045 | ≥ +0.032 | +2.9 to +3.0 |
| file, but `MIN_STEP_P` 4 | +0.029 to +0.033 | ≥ +0.025 | +2.0 to +2.3 |
| file, but `MONO_END_SHARE` 0.25 | +0.036 to +0.038 | ≥ +0.031 | a tie with 0.5 |
| file, but `MONO_END_SHARE` off | +0.030 to +0.034 | ≥ +0.024 | worse |
| file, but `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` off | +0.037 to +0.041 | ≥ +0.030 | ≈ 2 |
| file, but `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 4 (today) | +0.008 to +0.010 | ≥ +0.002 | the switch at 4 costs ≈ 0.03 |
| file + `OPEN_WAIT` 0 | +0.042 to +0.044 | ≥ +0.033 | +0.005 more, but see checkpoint 1 [?] |
| file + `HOLD_TICKS` 5 | ≈ the file | | no gain |

**What changes from checkpoint 1:**
- **The file stands, and its estimated gain grows** from +0.027 to ≈ +0.037 per duel.
- **`LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 4 → 2 is the biggest single piece:** +0.018 to +0.021 alone.
- **`MONO_END_SHARE` 0.5 vs 0.25 is now a tie** (±0.001, within noise). The role-blind model preferred 0.5 by 0.003;
  both beat "off" by ≈ 0.005. **Keep 0.5:** it's no worse anywhere and better with reciprocity.
- **`MIN_STEP_P` 6 beats 5 by ≈ +0.005 in every cell and in both simulators.** But each notch moves further from
  anything we've played: at 6 with an 18% cap, nothing goes out mid-duel under a ~33 P gap. **Suggested use of the hot
  reload:** start Duels III at 5, and step to 6 after wave 1 if the wave shows rounds ≥ 4 and a deal rate ≥ 0.85 (the
  tuner's rule).
- **Not re-run on the role-aware model:** the thin-margin, accept and opener conclusions came from exact replays or are
  unchanged in direction.

## Overnight program, checkpoint 1 (Sat 22:40): Duels III and the Final

_For Aleks's Sunday morning. Duels III and the Final: 12 ticks, 10% decay, 4 at once, price + day
(`/api/schedule` at 22:08: Duels III `rounds` 2 = 68 duels; the Final `rounds` 1 = 34)._
- _**Sources:** code and raw outputs in the scratchpad `night/` (`sim2.py`, `final4.out`, `final5.out`, `final2.out`,
  `search_n1.out`, `validate2_v2.out`, `calib2.out`, `fit2.out`, `reaction_buckets.out`, `pies2.out`, `clusters.out`,
  `tuner.py`, `tuner_dryrun.out`) and `lab2/` (`thin.out`, `worse_than_standing.out`)._
- _**Scope:** code-only. No LLM spend, no game writes, no duelist process._
- _**Checked:** a verifier pass audited the first draft (1 high, 10 lower flags); this version fixes them all and re-runs
  against a baseline whose late switch fires like the live code._
- _**Labels:** [V] measured on records or code, [L] modelled, [?] unknown._

### Params file for Duels III (Chief's 23:00 ask) [L]

**`MONO_END_SHARE` 0.5, not 0.25** (`night/mono.out`; 12 ticks / 10%, 5 worlds, 20,000 duels each).

- **How it's modelled:** our last-ticks concessions are drawn from our real ones (Duels I + II, n = 69: median 32% of
  the gap, 30% of them above half; `endsteps.out`), then capped. The accept-instead-of-worse guard (a1d679e) is on.

| `MONO_END_SHARE` | Live constants: Δ vs no cap | Proposed constants: Δ vs no cap | Deal rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.25 | −0.0015 (worst −0.0022) | +0.0016 (worst +0.0001) | 0.884 |
| **0.5** | **+0.0023** (all worlds +0.0020 to +0.0026) | **+0.0044** (+0.0042 to +0.0047) | **0.903** |
| off (1.0) | 0 | 0 | 0.907-0.908 |

- **0.5 wins in every combination tested:** both scoring readings (H2 +0.0024 / +0.0042) and with rival reciprocity
  0.5 (+0.0017 / +0.0041).
- **0.25 costs 0.004 per duel against 0.5,** and 2 points of deal rate. That agrees with the Builder's price-only
  result.

**`run/duel_params.json`**, validated with the duelist-loop branch's own `params.validate()`: no errors.

```json
{
 "_note": "Duel Lab overnight proposal for Duels III / Final (12 ticks, 10% decay): MIN_STEP_P 5, MAX_STEP_SHARE 0.18, LATE_SWITCH_LEFT 2 (+0.027/duel in the days simulator, 5 rival worlds) and MONO_END_SHARE 0.5 (+0.004 vs off, 0.25 is worse). Evidence: intel/duel-lab.md. Aleks approves before it goes live.",
 "MIN_STEP_P": 5,
 "MAX_STEP_SHARE": 0.18,
 "LATE_SWITCH_LEFT": 2,
 "MONO_END_SHARE": 0.5
}
```

Everything else stays at today's constants: `MIN_STEP_SHARE` 0.05 (≤ 0.18, the cross-check holds), `OPEN_WAIT` 2,
`ACCEPT_BY` 2, `HOLD_TICKS` 3, `SILENT_KEEP` 0.15, `GIVE_COST_P` 15.

### Recommendation: three constants, ≈ +1.85 duel points over Duels III [L]

**Baseline = the live code:** `MIN_STEP_P` 3, `MIN_STEP_SHARE` 0.05, `MAX_STEP_SHARE` 0.25, `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 4 (fires
whenever the days differ), `OPEN_WAIT` 2, `ACCEPT_BY` 2, `HOLD_TICKS` 3, `SILENT_KEEP` 0.15, give the day only when
C ≤ 15. **Cells:** 12 ticks, 10% decay, 5 rival worlds, 20,000 duels each (`final4.out`, `final5.out`).

| Change (live → proposed) | Where | Δ per duel, alone |
|---|---|---|
| `MIN_STEP_P` 3 → **5** | `agent.py:50` | +0.007 (worst world +0.004) |
| `MAX_STEP_SHARE` 0.25 → **0.18** (the 16:30 value; a40ced6 raised it to "close faster") | `agent.py:52` | +0.002 (+0.000) |
| `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 4 → **2** | `agent.py:54` | +0.011 (+0.006); switch off entirely: +0.013 |
| **All three (Q4)** | | **+0.027** (worst world +0.020, best +0.033); H2 scoring +0.026. **≈ +1.85 points over 68 Duels III duels, +0.9 in the Final.** Baseline ≈ 0.36 per duel, so +7%. The CI (±0.002) is Monte Carlo noise only: **no duel has been played at 12 ticks / 10%** |

**What this changes in behaviour (read before shipping).**
- **The mechanism.** With a 5 P floor and an 18% cap, a capped mid-duel step under 5 P is held, so no mid-duel
  concession goes out while the gap is under ~28 P (today: under ~12 P). Those duels close in the last 3 ticks (code
  never holds there) or by the deadline accept.
- **The gain is all in that hold.** Sending 5 P instead of holding (`final5.out`, "floor wins") scores −0.002, i.e.
  nothing. **The lever is fewer mid-duel messages in narrow gaps**, which matches the Chief's thin-margin duels
  (6095, 6171, 6184: 7-8 rounds for 3-11 P of worth).
- **Stronger:** `MIN_STEP_P` 6 (Q5): +0.031, worst +0.022. **Gentler:** `MIN_STEP_P` 4: +0.022.
- **Robust to reciprocity** (`night/react.out`). If rivals answer each P of our step with 0.25-1.0 P of extra
  concession (the data hints big steps draw bigger replies), Q4's gain grows slightly: +0.028 / +0.029 / +0.030, worst
  world ≥ +0.022. Q5: up to +0.034.
- **Conflict to know about:** the earlier days model (`lab/days.md`) found the late switch slightly positive
  (+0.004; +0.013 against rivals that never move their day). That model wasn't calibrated on Duels II. In the real
  records, one exact case shows it costing (6094) and one possibly saving a deal (5801). Moving it to 2 ticks left keeps
  it as the last-moment deal-saver.

**Two code guards from the records, for the Builder [V records, L value]:**
1. **Never send an offer worth less to us than the rival's standing offer; accept theirs instead,** re-reading the duel
   just before sending.
   - It happened 4 times in 54 Duels II duels (`worse_than_standing.out`): 5618 ×2 (before the day fix), 5968 (sent
     28.9 while their 33.0 stood) and 6095 (sent 3.0 while their 6.0 stood, then they took our 3.0).
   - About +2 P each in 5968 and 6095. There is no downside: the rule only fires when their offer beats ours.
2. **Enforce the day call on our FIRST offer.** If `day_read` says hold (C > 15), the opener goes on our own day, or
   its price must carry ≥ C.
   - **6049 [V]:** our first offer took the rival's day 10 at 82 (worth 40.7), against "100 on day 0" (worth 48) in our
     own words. The 10 days cost us C = 25.3 P but we asked only 18 P for them, and the live rule (give only when
     C ≤ 15) said hold. The LLM opener overrode it and nothing in code enforces it.
   - The model agrees giving the day above 15 P loses: C ≤ 30 −0.018, always −0.057 per duel (`search_n1.out`, older
     baseline).

**Not recommended, though the model likes them:**
- **A fixed code opener at 0.55 × limit** (opener alone ≈ +0.037; the +0.063 is the whole C2 package). The raw data
  disagrees: our 9 Duels II openers above 1.0 × limit all closed, with the best mean result (27.1 P). The model draws
  our opener independently of the pie, and that's probably wrong. [?]
- **`OPEN_WAIT` 2 → 0** (+0.006): the models conflict (the days model valued waiting for their day). Keep. [?]
- **`ACCEPT_BY` 1** (+0.006, `search_n1.out`, older baseline): a missed settle on 15 s ticks costs the whole deal.
- **Thin-margin accept rules (the Chief's ask) [V replay, `lab2/thin.out`]:** "accept when theirs ≥ (1 − d)^k ×
  ours after round 3" (k = 2, 3, 4), "gap < 10 P", "our standing worth < 10/15 P".
  - All within ±1% of actual on 48 post-fix Duels II duels, re-scored at 8%, 10% and 12% decay.
  - In 6171 and 6184 no better offer ever stood: the rival sat on its own day and the only deal was on ours. The
    thin-duel loss is rounds, which the 5 P floor addresses, not accepts.
- **Confirmed no-change** (`search_n1.out`, older baseline with cap 0.18; directions only):
  - opener scale ×0.8 / ×1.2 (both lose);
  - accept thresholds (≈ 0);
  - `SILENT_KEEP` 0 or 0.3 (both lose a little);
  - end-game step size and `DECIDE_LEFT` (both directions lose).

### 1. Rival fits on the Duels II transcripts [V counts, L types]

- **Price behaviour (35 closed duels, `clusters.out`):**
  - reply-only: 66%;
  - clock: 17%;
  - one-shot / accept-only: 14%;
  - silent: 3%.
- **Day behaviour:**
  - locked at its own best day: 34%;
  - moves (copies ours or erratic): 31%;
  - locked at the far end (day-blind?): 17%;
  - locked at day 5: 14%.
- **Reaction to our step** (`reaction_buckets.out`; 67 exchanges, several per duel, so not independent) [L]:
  - after our steps under 20% of the gap, they gave a median 8-13% of the gap whatever our size;
  - after steps of 20%+ (n = 13, often at the end) they gave more, a median 30%.
  - In absolute P the slope is ≈ 0 (corr −0.06). The simulator assumes no reaction.
- **Pies are bigger than in Duels I:** inferred median 0.41 × our limit vs 0.26, and our median share is 0.60 (14
  duels with a single-deal score jump, `pies2.out`).
- **The worth formula reproduces the game's `result` in all 33 closed deals checked (`lab2/d2_v3.out`) [V].**

### 2. Simulator validation [L; partly in-sample]

- **Calibrated** on the first 32 post-fix Duels II duels (`calib2.out`): deal rate, rounds, worth per deal, result per
  duel and share within about ±12% (worth/limit −11% in V2, rounds −12% in V3).
- **Re-validated on the current simulator over all 50 post-fix duels, ~18 of them played after calibration
  (`validate2_v2.out`):**
  - predicted total result vs actual: +7% / −3% / +4% (V1 / V2 / V3);
  - the actual result falls inside the simulated 10-90% band in 42-46 of 50 duels (the expected ~40, so the bands run a
    little wide: a weak test);
  - mean per-duel error ≈ 10 P. A per-deal ±10% match isn't achievable with unknown rival limits.
- **Five worlds:** three calibrated, one with the exact Duels II rival mix, one where 80% of rivals price the day.

### 3. Latency: code-first moves (design for the Builder) [L]

- **Live today [V]:** Duels II decisions averaged 9.4 s on Opus medium, 29% over 10 s. Sunday's decision budget is
  10 s.
- **Design:**
  - The LLM makes **one** decision per duel: the opener, during the 2-tick `OPEN_WAIT`.
  - **Later moves are code:**
    - step = about 12-15% of the gap in worth, held when under `MIN_STEP_P`, cut at `MAX_STEP_SHARE` × gap;
    - accept, day and holds = the existing closer, `day_read` and hold rules.
  - **Text:** the template "I can do N P, delivery on day D.", or an optional Sonnet-low text with a hard 3 s cap that
    never delays the send.
- **Model support is indirect.** The simulator's "LLM step" is a random step drawn to match Duels II, not the model
  itself. A 12% code step scored like it (C1 +0.027 vs P1 +0.024), but in a package with `OPEN_WAIT` 0 and the switch
  off (`final2.out`).
- **Untested:** sends landing "within a second". The test bar: a fake server at 15 s ticks with 4 concurrent duels,
  every send within 5 s of its tick.

### 4. Between-waves tuner (`night/tuner.py`; advisory: Aleks approves, the Builder wires the hot-reload)

- **What it does:** proposes at most `MIN_STEP_P` (3-8) and `HOLD_TICKS` (2-5) changes, one notch per wave.
  `MAX_STEP_SHARE` has bounds only (0.12-0.25), with no automatic rule.
- **Guardrails:**
  - nothing changes before 6 closed duels;
  - a change is reverted if the next wave scores under 0.7× the session mean;
  - **it writes the params file only when a rule fires,** and refuses to run with neither a params file nor `--base`
    (the duelist's current constants), so a reload can never reset the constants.
- **Dry run on Duels II** with `--base` = the proposed constants: no rule fired (deal rate 0.904 among rivals that
  spoke, 3.8 rounds per deal; `tuner_dryrun.out`).
- **Untested in the model:** a wave is about 4 duels, so it's a safety valve, not an optimiser.

_Next: 01:00 checkpoint (re-run on the complete Duels II set), then 04:00 / 07:30 final, verified._

## Update Sat 22:30: for Sunday (Duels III ≈ 11:00, 12 ticks, 10% decay, 4 at once; the Final the same)

_Data: the closed Duels II records in `docs/duels/` (30 for the 21:50 replays, 32-33 by 22:20) and Duels I. Outputs in
the scratchpad `lab2/`: `fast_v2.out`, `rules_v2.out`, `rules10.out` (the same replays re-scored at Sunday's 10% decay),
`d2_v3.out`, `latency.out`, `lateswitch.out`._

_Method: each replay takes an offer the rival actually made, at the moment it appeared, with the rounds counted up to
that moment. Messages are kept in the game's own order. A first draft re-sorted them (the rival first within each tick);
the verifier caught it, and everything below is re-run. Worth is days-aware (buyer: limit − price − w·day; seller:
price − limit + w·day), and it reproduces the game's `result` in **all 33 closed deals** [V]. Units are P of
`result`: pies are known for only 6 Duels II duels [L: P overweights big pies]. Two verifier passes are applied._

**Bottom line for Sunday: fix latency; keep the accept rules. Two small optional tweaks.**

| # | Change | Evidence | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Fit the 15 s tick.** Strategist on Opus `--effort low`, not medium. Fix the failover budget (`engine/failover.py` `timeout_s` = 20 s): it is longer than the runner's whole-decision timeout (`runner.py`: max(8, tick − 5) = 10 s at 15 s ticks), so a slow primary never reaches the backup. The backup still runs on a fast error or during the 120 s cooldown | **Duels II, Opus medium, 6 at once [V]:** model decisions mean 9.4 s, p95 13.6 s, max 20 s; 29% over 10 s (35% in the later waves). If Sunday looked the same, about a third of model moves would become code fallbacks [L: projection]. **Duels I, Opus low, 3 at once [V]:** mean 6.3 s, p90 7.2 s, 7% over 8 s, 1% over 10 s; at least two decisions over 12 s, max 25 s. Effort and load are confounded. **Aleks's red team [L]:** Opus low max 8.0 s; points per duel 0.386 (Opus low), 0.424 (Opus medium), 0.273 (Sonnet medium, 70% closed). `saturday-plan.md` plans a Sonnet strategist for Sunday; on those numbers Opus low is the better trade | Smoke with 4 concurrent days duels at 15 s ticks: p95 under 9 s and no `timeout` fallbacks |
| 2 | **Accept rules: keep the closer.** Optional: break-even **only in the last 4 ticks** (accept a standing in-limit offer when their last step < d/(1−d) × its worth and ≤ 4 ticks are left) | **[V replays]** The broad rules all lose. After the day fix, at 8% decay: break-even at any time −65.7 P, accept-first −47% per duel, B (≥ 50% of our opener) −10%, `ACCEPT_BY` 3 −1.5 P. **Re-scored at 10%:** break-even −9%, accept-first −49%. **Only two endgame variants are flat or slightly positive:** break-even from 4 ticks left +2.7 P (8%) / +3.1 P (10%) over 24-32 duels (5662, 6094), and "their jump ≥ 15% of the gap within 4 ticks" +0.4 / +0.8. Duels I in share: break-even −0.67, accept-first −2.94 of 9.06 | Offline runner: in-limit offer at 4 ticks left with their last step under d/(1−d) × its worth → accept; a bigger step → no accept |
| 3 | **Late switch: optional narrowing.** Skip it when an in-limit rival offer is standing **and** the rival posts without waiting for us (a clock bot) | [V `lateswitch.out`] 9 firings by 21:55: 6 with an in-limit offer standing, 2 without (5801 then closed at 3.6; 5813 no deal), 1 live. **Clock rival (6094: it posted every tick, 1273-1287):** the replay is exact, and the switch's extra round cost 24.1 → 28.5 at 8%. **Reply-only rivals (5662, 5663):** their better offer came right after our switch, so the switch may have drawn it [L]. n = 1 exact case | Offline runner: a clock rival with an in-limit offer at 4 ticks left → no switch; a reply-only rival → the switch goes out |

**The Chief's three duels, plus the real leaks [V transcripts, game order]:**
- **5653 and 5797 aren't losses.** Their earlier "in-limit" offers were in limit on price only: 93 on day 10 was worth
  −2.3 to us, 60 on day 10 was worth −12.3. **Any such check must use worth including the day.**
- **The real leaks share one pattern: late in the duel, we countered an improved in-limit rival offer instead of
  taking it** (verifier's figures):
  - 5808 −1.4: their 159 on day 0 (worth 36) arrived at round 4; we sent one more offer and took 158 at round 5.
  - 5662 −2.4: their 100 came at round 6; we countered 110 and took the same 100 at round 7.
  - 6094 −2.1: we echoed their 65 instead of accepting it.
  - 5663 −0.4.
  - Total ≈ 6 P over the first ~30 duels: about 1% of the result.
- **The endgame break-even (#2) targets exactly this pattern,** and it is the only accept rule that doesn't lose on
  replay.
- **The "33% lost to decay in wave 3"** is the Chief's figure. These replays show it as the price of haggling that paid:
  cutting rounds by accepting earlier lost more than it saved.

**Also check for Duels III (12 ticks) [?, not modelled]:** the fixed tick constants were set for 16-tick duels:
`OPEN_WAIT` 2, `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 4, `ACCEPT_BY` 2, `DECIDE_LEFT` 3, `HOLD_TICKS` 3. With 12 ticks they cover a larger
share of each duel. The overnight search will test them.

## Update Sat 18:30: second pass before the 19:30 freeze (Chief's three questions)

**Answer: one change, as insurance. Everything Aleks picked from the Lab's list is live** (69ef465 + 89a6dd6, running
since 17:15). The fixed 15% step and `HOLD_TICKS` 3 → 5 were declined at 16:24 and stay out.

**1. Pairings: not visible [V].**
- `/api/duels` lists 0 live duels (tick 972).
- `/api/schedule` gives only the parameters: Duels II at hour 11.65 ≈ 20:33, `rounds` 2 (each team plays us 4 times),
  16 ticks, 8% decay, 6 at once, price + days.
- **The meeting order can't predict the rival either [V].** The order differs between sessions: by Friday id, R3, R15,
  R7, R8, R1, R13, R4, R5 (`docs/duel-rivals.md`), against R1, R3, R4, R5, R7, R8, R13, R15 in Duels I.
- **So rivals can only be identified live**, from the first line's wording (fingerprints in `docs/duel-rivals.md`). The
  live day and step rules don't depend on the cluster, so no per-cluster parameters are needed.

**2. Duels I losses, re-checked with days in play.**
- **The 4 no-deals can't be recovered by a rule [V transcripts]:**
  - 2367: R5 never came inside our limit (its lowest was 83 against our 72).
  - 2414/2415: R6 was silent (Team 11 [L]).
  - 2523: R13 was silent in that role. The only lever is the silent walk, and it already goes further:
    `SILENT_KEEP` 0.15 walks to 183 of our 196, not 170.
- **Days may silence more scripted bots** (a priced message without `days` is refused). The walk and the accept-only
  path cover that, and both are live, but the walk runs only when we can read our day weight (`runner.py`: an unreadable
  days duel stays with the models).
- **The rounds loss.** The 18% step cap is live.
- **Aleks's "stay silent against clock bots", re-scored in share** [L: the pies are inferred] (`silence_share.out`, 10
  of his 12 duels: 2460 and 2507 have no pie): **−0.19** share-points as a rule for every clock-bot rival (R15 −1.00),
  **+0.80** for R4, R9 and R13 only. It works only as a rule keyed to the rival's
  wording, and that needs a matcher built before the freeze, with no evidence the wording survives the days update.
  **Not worth it tonight.**
- **The biggest swing left is our day reading [L, Aleks's red team, `docs/duelist-redteam.md`].**

  | Our reading of the day weight | Points per duel |
  |---|---|
  | read right | 0.47 |
  | direction unknown | 0.23 |
  | can't read | 0.15 |
  | direction backwards | −0.18, with 30% of deals worth less than nothing |

  - **The danger:** backwards against right is ≈ 0.65 per duel in the red team's simulated share score [L], about 4
    points per wave of 6.
  - **The gap today [V code]:** there is no switch to flip or distrust the reading. `read_days` has no flag, no
    environment variable and no override file.
  - **The cost of fixing it live [L, my guess at the timing]:** a wrong reading at 20:33 would need a code edit, the
    suite and a restart mid-session. At about 8 minutes per wave, that's probably 2-4 waves, or 8-16 points.

**3. Changes for Aleks.**
1. **Day-reading override, default off** [L, insurance].
   - **What:** `supervise.sh … --days-read auto|flip|unsure`, passed through to `read_days`.
     - `flip`: reverse the reading's direction (for a linear weight, day d gets day 10 − d's value; our best end
       becomes the other end), and `sure` stays.
     - `unsure`: set `sure = False`, the safe "direction unknown" mode (0.23/duel, no negative deals in the red team).
     - `auto` (the default) behaves exactly as now.
   - **Tests:**
     - the red-team "backwards" fixture with `flip` scores as "read right";
     - `auto` passes the current suite unchanged.
   - **Runbook, 20:33:** read the console's day line against the game's `days_meaning`.
     - Clearly reversed: restart with `flip`. A restart doesn't re-send (records).
     - Ambiguous: restart with `unsure`.
   - **Worth [L]:** 0 if the reading is right. If it's backwards, about 1 wave lost instead of 2-4, which saves ≈ 4-12
     points (red-team share score, my timing guess).
   - **The freeze rule (PLAN #23)** asks for a clear sim gain. This change has none by default: `auto` is today's code.
     Its gain exists only if the reading is wrong, so whether it qualifies is Aleks's call.
2. **No other change.** The step cap, the day tweaks, `SILENT_KEEP`, per-duel accepts and the 2-tick day wait are all
   live, and the red team found no tweak clearly better (best +1.7%).

_Everything below is the 16:15 report, unchanged._

## Bottom line

- **Step size is the lever. Cap each mid-duel concession at about 18% of the gap, or better, make it about 15%.**
  - Every step-size variant gains in all four calibrated versions of the rival model ("worlds"):
    - a cap alone: +0.9 to +4.0 duel points over Duels II's 68 duels;
    - a fixed 15% step: +1.8 to +3.9.
  - The merged plan's baseline is about 20-25 points.
  - The four worlds are parameter sets of **one** simulator, so they share its structure.
- **Days:** keep the merged rule and add three tweaks:
  - never pre-pay to keep our day;
  - switch to their day late rather than let a day standoff kill the deal;
  - when they open on a middle day, propose our own corner.
  - Modelled gain: about +1.2 points, up to +3.1 if rivals open mid.
- **Leave alone:**
  - **Accept rules:** an exact replay on the real transcripts confirms Aleks's call [V].
  - **Opener:** keep it. The model leans slightly to lowering it (+0.7 to −0.2, 3 of 4 worlds positive), but its known
    bias favours closing fast, and the replay says lowering it costs about 5%.
- **Score in share, not primas [V].** Duel points are not proportional to P. Every replay so far summed P, and that
  overweights the big-pie duels.

## 1. Two facts the rest stands on

**Duel points are not proportional to P [V]; they fit share × (1 − d)^rounds per deal [L].**
- Our `duel_points` (`scores.jsonl`) jump each time a deal closes.
- Over 6 single-deal intervals the jump per primas earned ranges 8× (0.012-0.100):
  - 2585 made 60.2 P and moved us +0.72;
  - 2319 made 3.4 P and moved us +0.34.
- Each jump fits that deal's share of the gap between the two limits (as Aleks inferred). The pie itself is solved from
  the jumps, so that reading is [L].
- **Consequence:** a 10 P pie counts as much as an 80 P one. The P-weighted replays in `docs/duels-1-review.md` and
  score-model §1d weigh duels by size.
- Re-scored in share (`extra.out`, `replay.out`). **No verdict flips**; the sizes change:
  - **Anchor closer** (opener at 75% of the distance, rounds held fixed), on the 20 deals with a known pie:
    −0.47 share-points (−5.2%). In P on the same deals: −30 P. Aleks's −43 P is over all deals.
  - **Accept the rival's first in-limit offer:** 9.06 → 6.12 share-points (−32%). Aleks's P replay gave −28%, the
    Analyst's −55%. Haggling paid.

**The rival's limit can be estimated for 20 of our 30 Duels I deals [L].**
- Our 26 score samples make 25 intervals; 20 of them hold exactly one closed deal of ours. For each, pie = result ÷ jump.
- All 20 implied shares are ≤ 1 when the jump is matched to the feed's `duel.closed` tick. Matching one tick later
  gives a share of 1.05 and a pie of 302, so that reading is wrong.
- Pies run 10-84 P, median 0.26 × our limit. Our opener sits at 1.5 pies on median: it asks for more than the whole pie,
  as theirs do.

## 2. The rival-response model (fitted on Duels I)

| What | Duels I evidence | In the simulator |
|---|---|---|
| Opener | Rivals ask on median 1.4× the (inferred) pie, beyond our limit; 4 of 18 open inside it ("We can do N P. Thank you for the talk.") [L] | Rival demand drawn from the 18 observed openers |
| Concession | [V transcripts, L types]. **Fast, then hold:** 2296/97, 2430/31. **Slow every tick:** 2318/19, 2356/57, 2460/61, 2522, 2534, 2540/41. **Bursts:** 2506/07. **Repeaters:** 2366/67, 2535 | A mix of fast (35-65% of the distance per move) and slow (2-8%) rivals, plus a "two moves then hold" type |
| Reaction to us | Weak. Their step ≈ 0.24 × ours + 0.06 × gap + 1.4 (Aleks, R² 0.11) [V]. Our opener barely changes their total concession: corr 0.13, n 23 (`extra.out`) [V] | + 0.24 × our last step |
| Acceptance | Took our offer at a rival share of 0.06-0.42 [V]. Refused 0.0-0.35, except the 2430 holder, which refused about 0.46 and 0.61. 2534 refused 0.12, 0.18 and 0.23, then took 0.27. Laxer near the deadline: 2494 took 0.06 near the end, 2495 took 0.19 at the deadline | Threshold τ drawn per rival, lower in the last 3 ticks |
| Talk | Silent, no deal: 3 of 34 (Team 11 + 2523). At most one message, then accept-only: about 6 of 34 (2314/15, 2472/73, 2446, 2495). The rest message most ticks [V] | The same mix |
| Teams | Rivals come in pairs with the same template; each team plays us 4 times in Duels II. Rival book in the appendix [L] | — |

**Validation.** No single parameter set fits every statistic, so I bracket with four worlds (`validate.out`):

| | Duels I actual | W1 base | W2 fast/slow mix | W3 tough accept | W4 lumpy steps + tough accept |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deal rate | 0.88 | 0.90 | 0.90 | 0.90 | 0.90 |
| Rounds per deal | 4.4 | 4.28 | 4.20 | 4.45 | 4.08 |
| Deals in ≤ 1 round / ≥ 7 rounds | 0.30 / 0.27 | 0.29 / 0.24 | 0.25 / 0.23 | 0.21 / 0.25 | 0.22 / 0.18 |
| Points per duel (share × decay) | 0.41 | 0.394 | 0.374 | 0.319 | 0.310 |
| Deals closed on our accept | ≈ 0.4 | 0.13 | 0.22 | 0.31 | 0.19 |
| Out-of-sample: "accept first in-limit" ÷ actual | 0.68 | 0.87 | 0.79 | 0.75 | 0.79 |
| Deals closing ≥ 75% of our opener's distance | 0.17 | 0.17 | 0.11 | 0.05 | 0.04 |
| Our mid-duel step ÷ gap: median / q75 / share ≥ ¼ | 0.16 / 0.27 / 0.27 | 0.11 / 0.18 / 0.14 | 0.14 / 0.24 / 0.23 | 0.15 / 0.27 / 0.28 | 0.17 / 0.32 / 0.34 |

How well each world fits:
- **W1** fits the outcomes (deal rate, rounds, points per duel), but its steps are smoother than ours.
- **W3** best matches our real step spread. W4 is lumpier than the data.
- **W2-W4** trade outcome fit for the out-of-sample target and score too low (0.31-0.37 vs 0.41).
- **Every world misses out of sample** (0.75-0.87 vs 0.68): the model's rivals make too few thin early in-limit offers,
  so it undervalues haggling.

What I trust it for:
- **Yes:** comparing step sizes and hold timing. Those change share, mostly upward.
- **No:** changes that only trade share for rounds, like the opener.
- **Its simplifications:**
  - price-only (no days);
  - in the last 3 ticks it concedes 50% of the gap mechanically;
  - `HOLD_TICKS` forces a step there, where the code asks the model again.

## 3. Policy search at d = 8% (16 ticks)

- **Baseline:** the merged plan, as `default_policy` with the 3 P floor and `MIN_STEP_SHARE` 0.05. No offer budget,
  `HOLD_TICKS` 3, silent walk to 30%, accept by 2 ticks left, small-gap closer.
- **Our step size:** the Duels I fit, 3.1 + 0.21 × their step + 0.025 × gap, with noise.
- **Method:** 20,000 duels per cell, paired (same duels, same rivals). 95% CIs are ±0.05 to ±0.15 points.
- **Units:** Δ is in duel points over 68 duels. Baseline level per world: 25.3 / 24.2 / 20.8 / 20.3 (`final.out`).

| Change (where) | W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | Average |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1d. Every mid-duel concession = 15% of the gap** (code sets the size: small steps raised, big ones cut; 3 P floor still holds) | **+1.82** | **+2.40** | **+2.66** | **+3.93** | **+2.70** |
| 1c. Clamp to 12-18% of the gap | +1.67 | +2.20 | +2.37 | +3.67 | +2.48 |
| **1a. Cap at 18%:** a bigger concession is cut back to 18% of the gap, then the existing floor check runs (held if under max(3 P, 5% of the gap), so under a ~17 P gap a capped step is held) | **+0.93** | **+1.92** | **+2.36** | **+3.95** | **+2.29** |
| 1b. 1a + `MIN_STEP_SHARE` 0.05 → 0.10 | +0.95 | +2.19 | +2.78 | +4.41 | +2.58 |
| 2. `HOLD_TICKS` 3 → 5 (`runner.py`) | +0.02 (n.s.) | +0.36 | +0.53 | +0.84 | +0.44 |
| 3. `SILENT_KEEP` 0.3 → 0.15 (silent walk goes further) | +0.20 | +0.16 | +0.17 | +0.08 | +0.15 |
| 4. Opener ×0.9 | +0.74 | +0.38 | +0.16 | −0.19 | +0.27 |
| 1c + 2 + 3 | +1.54 | +2.32 | +2.68 | +4.02 | |
| 1a + 2 + 3 | +0.94 | +2.11 | +2.72 | +4.22 | |

**Why step size wins [L, with data support].**
- **Our LLM's steps are lumpy [V].** Mid-duel (more than 3 ticks left) it conceded a median 16% of the gap; 27% of its
  steps were a quarter of the gap or more, up to 67%.
- **Big steps gave value away [V].** In Aleks's buckets, steps of a quarter of the gap or more drew 4.8 P back for
  7.5 P given.
- **What the model shows.** Capping or fixing the step raises our share of the pie in every world (+0.02 to +0.09).
  Rounds fall in W1-W3 and rise slightly in W4 (3.69 → 3.86).
- **It survives a stronger rival reaction.** With rivals answering at 2.5× the fitted reaction (ρ 0.6, `extra.out`):
  - cap: +0.91 / +1.80 / +2.20 / +3.78;
  - fixed 15%: +1.72 / +2.28 / +2.50 / +3.79.
- **1d vs 1a.** 1d beats 1a in W1-W3. 1d also raises small steps, and Aleks's buckets say small steps at large gaps
  drew 5.5 P back for 3.8. So 1a is the cautious version: it leaves small steps alone.

**Leave these alone.**
- **Accept rules: no early-accept rule [V, exact replay].** Replayed on the real transcripts of the 20 deals with a
  known pie, in share units. The rule only stops earlier, so no rival model is needed. Against our actual 9.06:
  - accept-first: 6.12;
  - break-even (rival step < S·d/(1−d)): 8.38;
  - "rival held once in-limit": 8.38;
  - "held twice": 8.88;
  - "their offer ≥ 0.7 × ours": 9.13 (+0.07, noise).
- **Deadline accepts.** In the earlier 3-world search (`search3.out`), accepting at 1 tick left instead of 2 adds only
  +0.4-0.5. It isn't worth risking a missed settle.

## 4. Delivery days (modelled only: no days duel has been played) [L/?]

Sub-model (`days_sim.py`, `days.md`, `r1m_out.txt`):
- **Money split:** Duels I shares and rounds.
- **Day weights:** linear, |w| 0.5-5 P/day, sign random, so about half the duels conflict.
- **Rival day types:** follower, price-for-day, integrative, soft-stubborn, hard-stubborn.
- **Scoring, both readings:** H1 = our gain ÷ best pie over the days; H2 = our gain ÷ pie at the agreed day. Which one
  the server uses is unknown [?].
- **Baseline:** R1m = the merged `day_read` (4699673).

**Recommendation: the merged rule with three changes.**
1. **Hold our day without pre-paying** (drop "pay up to C/2 to keep it" from the strategist guide). An aware rival's
   price already charges for its lost day. Worth +0.015/duel against R1m; 0 if anchors don't stick (κ = 0).
2. **Late switch.** If the day is still open with about 4 ticks left, offer their day at +C (worth-neutral) so a day
   standoff never costs the deal. Worth +0.002 in the main mix, +0.007/+0.010 (H1/H2) against rivals that never move
   their day.
3. **A middle-day opener (1-9) says nothing about their side.** Answer with our own corner (call = hold) instead of the
   merged `give_day = 10 − dv.best` (the far corner). That corner is both sides' worst day half the time. Worth +0.021
   (H1) / +0.001 (H2) when rivals open at day 5; it is the largest gain that survives κ = 0, where the late switch is
   also +0.009.

**Total against R1m:**
- main mix: +0.017 ± 0.001/duel (H1) / +0.018 (H2), about **+1.2 duel points over 68**;
- rivals opening at day 5: +0.045 (H1) / +0.027 (H2), up to +3.1 points.

**Also robust in the sub-model:**
- never settle a middle day (worst rule nearly everywhere);
- wait ≤ 2 ticks to see their day first (+0.013/duel, but the model doesn't charge the ticks);
- keep the give threshold;
- asking C + C or just C is a wash;
- the merged ranking thresholds already beat the review's R1 (0.310 vs 0.298 per duel).

## 5. Top changes for Aleks (ranked)

| # | Change | Expected Δ, 68 duels | Evidence | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Step size in `agent.held`.** Preferred: every mid-duel concession = **15% of the gap** in worth (1d). Cautious, two constants: new `MAX_STEP_SHARE = 0.18` cuts a bigger step back to 18% (1a), and the existing floor check then runs unchanged. Closing ticks and worth-neutral day swaps exempt. **A resized move must carry a code-written text** ("I can do N P.", as the silent walk does): the negotiator's draft names its own number | 1d: +1.8 to +3.9 · 1a: +0.9 to +4.0 (CIs ±0.1-0.15) | [L] 4 worlds + ρ 0.6 check; [V] our lumpy steps, Aleks's ≥ ¼ bucket | Model structure: all worlds share it. 1d enlarges the small steps that Aleks's data says paid |
| 2 | **Days, on top of the merged rule:** no pre-pay; late switch at ~4 ticks left; middle-day opener → our corner | ≈ +1.2 (up to +3.1 if rivals open mid) | [L] modelled only; H1/H2 [?] | Rival day behaviour invented. Gate: first-wave `pred` = `points` |
| 3 | **`HOLD_TICKS` 3 → 5** | 0 to +0.8 | [L] | More standoffs: the model's deal rate is unchanged (0.900 vs 0.899), but 103/104 were standoffs |
| 4 | **`SILENT_KEEP` 0.3 → 0.15** | +0.1 to +0.2 | [L] positive in all 4 worlds | Small either way |
| 5 | **Desk question: are duel accepts limited per duel or per team per tick?** | Making every code accept 1 tick earlier cost 0.5-0.8 (`search3.out`, 3 worlds) | [?] `/api/clock` lists only the trading limit (1 per team per tick); the deck says duel limits are separate | If they're per duel, `runner.closer`'s line-up (one accept per tick across 6 duels) forces needless early accepts |

**Not changing:** the opener, the accept rules, no offer budget, the 3 P floor.

**Optional (Aleks's §3.5 stretch):** give the strategist the appendix's rival book as facts when a first message
matches a template. This is untested in the model.

**How to read Δ.** Duels I gave us 13.93 duel points over 34 duels. The Analyst's §1b mapping (duel part ≤ 12 Saturday
points = 8 board) suggests about 0.4 board per duel point, if Duels II feeds the same part [?].

## 6. Risks and first-wave checks

- **Model risk [L].**
  - Rivals are fitted on 34 duels; their bots may change.
  - Within this simulator, the step-size gain is positive in every world and under ρ 0.6.
  - Still unknown: a structure the simulator lacks (e.g. rivals that read big steps as weakness and stop conceding),
    and the out-of-sample miss above.
- **Days scoring [?].** At the first deals of wave 1, check `pred` = `points` with the day value in. If it misses, read
  the jump: our gain ÷ best pie (H1) or ÷ pie at the agreed day (H2).
- **Day reading [V for code, ? for payload].** `days.py` has never seen the real `your_days_weight`. If it prints
  `CAN'T READ`, every day rule falls back to the models.
- **Live checks per wave** (`agents.duelist review`):
  - no concession over 18% of the gap outside the closing ticks (1a), or every one about 15% (1d);
  - our share per deal against Duels I's inferred ~0.58.
  - Rounds per deal can't tell the change apart: the baseline is already 3.7-4.0 in the model.

## Appendix: rival book (Duels I templates; each team plays us 4× in Duels II) [V transcripts, L types]

| Duels | Template (first message) | Type | What happened |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2296/2297 | "Thank you for meeting me. I can do N P." | Fast, then holds near the middle | We took theirs at shares .52/.54 after 4-6 rounds. In 2296 they offered 101 (share .73) at round 3, then slid back to 97 |
| 2318/2319 | "I can do N. That is a fair deal for both of us." | Slow every tick, accelerating +3..+15 | Took our offer at rival share .21/.40 after 9 rounds. Our messages only added rounds |
| 2356/2357 | "Propuesta justa para cerrar pronto…" (rotating Spanish lines) | Slow shrinking steps every tick | Took our 117 (rival .42); we took their 78 |
| 2366/2367 | "67?" / "101?" | Repeater, never moves | 2366 took our 110; 2367 no deal (never inside our limit) |
| 2430/2431 | "N for [item]. Every round costs us both…" | Two ~11 P steps, then a silent hold | Refused our offers even at a rival share ≈ 0.46-0.61; we took their number at the deadline (.20/.24) |
| 2460/2461 | "Happy to close quickly at N…" / "A real step from me" | Slow, 2-9 P every tick | 10-12 rounds; they took ours |
| 2472/2473 | "N P y cerramos ahora." | One message, then accept-only | Took our walk late, 1 round |
| 2506/2507 | "Propongo este precio, creo que es justo para los dos." | 9-12 P bursts every ~3 ticks | 6-7 rounds |
| 2540/2541 | "Hello! I can do N. Thank you for your time." | Shrinking steps every tick | Met our number (our share .87 in 2541) |
| 2584/2585 | "We can do N P. Thank you for the talk." | Generous opener inside our limit | Took our opener (2584) |
| singles | 2522 "Let's close it quickly" (1-2 P/tick) · 2534 "Puedo llegar a N primas" (took ours at .27) · 2535 "Es una pieza que merece su precio" (repeater, took ours at .24) · 2530 "Hi there. N P from my side." (we took 97: our share **.16** of a 63 P pie, the biggest leak) · 2446/2495 silent accept-only · 2414/2415/2523 silent, no deal | | |
