# Duelist re-audit: `origin/duelist-loop` at a99f641 (and 3a0f6f3) before Duels III and the Final

_Independent re-audit, Sun 00:50-01:20, for Aleks and Lucas. It checks the fixes for `intel/duelist-audit.md`._
- _**Scope:** offline only. Nothing touched the live server, no key was read or printed, and nothing changed on main
  or the branch. The work ran in temporary worktrees of 3a0f6f3, a99f641 and origin/main and in a throwaway clone;
  all of them were removed afterwards._
- _**`--check`, `--stop` and `--rollback`** ran with `git fetch` and `curl` stubbed, and with dummy processes standing
  in for a live duelist. No real duelist was started._
- _**Sources:** the session scratchpad's `reaudit/` folder holds the replay, probe, fuzz and script-test files and
  their `.out` outputs. Every number below is copied from those outputs._
- _**Labels:** [V] measured on the code or the records, [L] modelled (the Duel Lab's `sim3`)._

## Verdict: GO-WITH-CHANGES

**The duelist code is safe to start from a99f641. Run it as it is if the fix commit below can't land and be
re-checked by about 10:30; until then, follow the operating rules.**
- **The code:**
  - The full suite is green.
  - The 514 Duels II decisions were replayed through the code policy under sets C, A and today, both as recorded
    and rescaled to 12 ticks at 10%. None accepted below our limit, offered past it, named a wrong day or stepped
    backward.
  - 6,000 random duels per set with readable day weights raised no flag. (Unreadable weights are a separate,
    low-probability residual: R5.)
  - The switch now stops at A, and `--stop` stops everything and starts nothing.
- **What still needs the fix:** two defects in `tools/duelist_sunday.sh` and one value defect.
  1. `--rollback` crash-loops. The Lab's SUNDAY v2 names it "the tested way back", so this matters.
  2. A re-run while the duelist is live rewrites the live params file before it refuses.
  3. The seller opener: −0.022 a duel, modelled.

  A 6-file patch fixes all three, plus three smaller items: the params-file sentinel (R6), fetch tolerance (R9), and
  handing unreadable-weight duels to the models (R5, a partial mitigation). On a99f641 it passes the suite (576), the
  set C replays and the script tests. It is in the appendix.

**Aleks's command.** Paste the lines exactly as they are. They carry no `#` comments, because interactive zsh
doesn't treat `#` as a comment unless `interactivecomments` is set. The braces in `"${SHA}:tools/…"` matter: in zsh,
`$SHA:t` is a modifier and breaks the path.

```bash
git fetch origin
SHA=a99f6417b644922c7ccefdf03f33f0bdcd9762a2
COMMIT=$SHA bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh") --check
COMMIT=$SHA AUTOSWITCH=1 bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh")
```

- **Where:** your normal checkout.
- **`--check`:** it must print "steps 1-4 passed". Then run the second line.
- **The start:** `SET=C` and `POLICY=code` are the defaults. `AUTOSWITCH=1` is the Lab's recommendation, and safe
  now that the switch stops at A.
- **If the fix commit lands:** use the same lines with its sha. First check that `git diff --stat a99f641 <sha>`
  shows only the six patched files, and that `--check` passes (it runs the full suite).
- **Moving a running a99f641 duelist onto the fix commit:**
  1. Run `--stop` first. The patched `--check` refuses while a duelist runs.
  2. Start with the new sha and `SET=<the set now live>`.
- **Never use `origin/duelist-loop` in place of the sha,** in either spot: it is a moving ref.

**Operating rules on a99f641 as it is:**
- **Start once.** While the duelist runs, use only `--status` and `--stop`. Never re-run start or `--check`: before it
  refuses, it checks code out in the live worktree and rewrites the live params file (R2).
- **After a `--stop`, restart with `SET=<the set now live>`.** Check it in `--status`. After a switch, a plain re-run
  would put C back with the rule already spent.
- **Don't use `--rollback`** (R1). Roll back by hand from your checkout, one line at a time:
  ```bash
  SHA=a99f6417b644922c7ccefdf03f33f0bdcd9762a2
  bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh") --stop
  pgrep -fl "agents.duelist run|duelist/supervise.sh|duel_loop.py switch"
  git checkout main
  git status --short agents engine
  mkdir -p logs/duelist && (set -a; . ./.env; set +a; nohup agents/duelist/supervise.sh --negotiator-model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort medium --negotiator-effort low > logs/duelist/supervise-rollback.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &)
  ```
  - **`pgrep` must print nothing.** If it prints a process, the stop didn't happen. Kill that process before starting
    main's duelist, or two duelists end up on the team key: the lock is per checkout.
  - **`git status` must print nothing,** too.
  - **The start line** uses Saturday's flags, which main's `run` accepts (checked offline).
- **For the Final:** if a switch happened in Duels III, start with `SET=A` (Lab: start on the set Duels III ended on).

## Tests

| Commit | `uv run python -m pytest -q tests` |
|---|---|
| 3a0f6f3 | **574 passed** |
| a99f641 | **576 passed** (+2: the switch stops at A; `--stop` starts nothing) |
| a99f641 + the appendix patch | **576 passed** |

On origin/main (950ac89), `tests/test_duelist.py` gives **77 passed**, and that is the test `--rollback` runs
(`main_test_duelist.out`). `git diff a99f641...950ac89` touches only `agents/dealers` and two of their tests: nothing
in `agents/duelist` or `engine`. `agents/` and `engine/` are identical at 3a0f6f3 and a99f641 (`main_drift.out`).

## The audit's items, one by one

| Audit item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **S1: the give retreat** (code policy) | **Fixed** [V] | `policy.code_day` returns a premium of 0 on a give, and the small-step hold stays on once we are on their day. Replay: 0 backward moves; the 9 duels and 34 decisions the audit flagged are clean. Probe (buyer, limit 100, 1.2 a day): opens at 51 on day 10, then holds. It used to go 34 → 28 → 22 → 17 → 12 |
| **Per-role openers** | **Done, but against the Lab** [V/L] | Sellers open at 0.74 × the limit in price, median, which is **1.00 × the limit in worth**. The models opened at 0.63 in price and 0.73 in worth, and the Lab simulated 0.42 in price (≈ 0.69 in worth). The Lab's SUNDAY v2 retracted the per-role item as its own units error (R3) |
| **Missing params file** | **Fixed mid-run, not at start** [V] | `Params._stamp` starts at `None`, which is also a missing file's stamp. On a fresh process `reload()` returns `{}`: the code defaults ("today") play silently with no warning (`probe_missing.out`). The test hides this by forcing `_stamp = "?"`. The script always writes the file first, so this bites only on another start path. Fix: a one-line sentinel (appendix) |
| **Failover at 8 s; a cancellation counts as a failure** | **Fixed** [V] | `failover.py:21` defaults to 8, and `:47-49` counts `CancelledError` and re-raises it. 3 tests cover `Failover` itself; the `--failover-s` pass-through was read in the code, not tested. Probe: two runner cancellations trip the primary, and the next call goes to the backup |
| **Prompt at `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` 0** | **Fixed** [V] | `late_switch_line()` drops the line at 0 and never states a tick count (test at `tests/test_duelist.py:877`). The only number the prompt still states is `DAY_SAME_SIDE_P`, which no set changes |
| **Whole-file sets** (`use`) | **Fixed** [V] | Writes `_set`, `_note` and every key, atomically. Refuses an unknown set or a broken sets file. The sets match `intel/duel-sets/{C,A,today}.json` exactly. Works under python3 3.9.6 and 3.14.4 (`use_pythons.out`) |
| **`approve` on a changed baseline** | **Fixed** [V] | Refuses unless `--force` (`duel_loop.py:958-961`) |
| **The one-way switch and its kill switch** | **Fixed in a99f641** [V] | On 3a0f6f3 the switch cascaded: 12 duels at 0.50 gave C → A, and 4 more at 0.75 (session 0.56) gave **A → today on the next wave**. On a99f641, `_switch` is `{"C": "A"}`, and the same probe ends on A: "the last step of the switch: nothing written". The kill-switch file (`run/duel_switch.off`) has a test. `--dry` and once-per-set (`switched_from`) were read in the code, not tested |
| **The set recorded on every decision** | **Fixed** [V] | `runner.py:410-415` writes `params_set` and the overrides into the log and the record. Probe confirmed; there is no unit test |
| **Mid-duel switch** | **Works** [V] | Same duel, same state: C holds at 160 (a step of 6 < 8). After `use A`, the next decision steps to 154, and the record says A |
| **A seller below its nominal limit** | **Fixed** [V] | `said_past_limit`: an offer of 70 on day 10 against a limit of 73 (worth +41.6) now goes out |
| **`first_day` give premium** | **Fixed** [V] | `extra = 0`. Duel 5622 moves 8 P (worth-neutral) instead of 22. A menu call still forces our best day (optional; only the LLM path uses it) |
| **An unreadable day weight** | **Partly fixed** [V] | `guarded()` now skips. `respond_code` still plays the duel, though, with the day as free: our 60 on day 0 against their 58 on day 10 → **accept**. The fuzz ran 6,000 duels with unreadable weights, taking the true cost as linear in the curve's scale (an assumption, so the counts are illustrative). Under C: 485 offers past the true limit, 5 accepts below it, 7 backward moves; under A: 494 / 5 / 7. The patch hands these duels to the models. It only mitigates: when the models fail, `safe_move` still treats the day as free, and the patched probe with failing models still accepts the 58 (`a99_patched_probe_unreadable.out`) |
| **S4 items** | **Mostly fixed** [V] | Fixed: the floor never goes below 1 P, a near-zero accept is blocked, accepts make no text call (0 calls), and NaN is refused. Not done: logging an accept-price mismatch, and restoring `switched` after a restart (moot under C) |

## Duels II replays on the new code (task 3)

The 514 Duels II decisions went through the code policy in the runner's order: closing, switch, silent, then
`respond` (`respond_code` → text call fails offline → plain words → `final`). The models' real offers also went
through `held` + `final`. Sets come from `docs/duel_sets.json` via `Params.reload`.

| Set | Setting | Code path: accept below limit / offer past limit / wrong day / backward > 1 P | Rounding-up ≤ 0.9 P |
|---|---|---|---|
| C | as recorded (16 ticks, 8%) | **0 / 0 / 0 / 0** | 0 |
| C | rescaled to 12 ticks, 10% | **0 / 0 / 0 / 0** | 0 |
| A | both | **0 / 0 / 0 / 0** | 6 (late switch) |
| today | both | **0 / 0 / 0 / 0** | 27 / 41 (late switch) |

- **Set C, code path, as recorded:**
  - holds: 224 small-step, 1 same-offer;
  - steps: 104 code steps, 68 openers, 57 silent-walk steps;
  - 29 worth floors;
  - accepts: 20 deadline, 11 small-gap.
- **Where each replay ran:**
  - C (as recorded and rescaled) and A rescaled ran on a99f641.
  - A as recorded, and today in both settings, ran on 3a0f6f3. `agents/` and `engine/` are identical between the two
    commits.
  - On the patched code only C was re-run: 0 flags, and the seller opener at 0.43 in price / 0.69 in worth.
- **Fuzz** (6,000 random duels a set, both roles, readable weights): no flags under C or under A. For unreadable
  weights, see the table above (R5).
- **The LLM path (only matters with `POLICY=llm`):** the guards still pass the models' own moves.
  - 10 backward moves on a day change. Some are the strategist's give premium. Others are late flips back to our
    day: 5813, 58 on day 10 → 92 on day 0 with 3 ticks left.
  - Middle-day openers (day 5 at `OPEN_WAIT` 0): `first_day` acts only once the rival has offered.
  - The audit listed both: the flip back as S4 (6190), the `first_day` gap under `OPEN_WAIT` 0 in S3. Both are still
    open.

## `tools/duelist_sunday.sh`, line by line (task 4)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Worktree isolation** | **Good** [V]. A detached worktree at the sha, outside your checkout. Start mode never touches the checkout's branch. `run/`, `logs/` and `.venv` are ignored, so the dirty check still allows a re-run |
| **Abort on red tests** | **Works** [V]. With a red test added: "1 failed, 574 passed … ABORT: tests red: not starting" |
| **Refusing a second duelist** | **The refusal works, but it comes too late** [V]. It is step 4 of 6. Steps 1-3 first check out the sha in the live worktree and rewrite the live params file. Test: a dummy duelist was running and the params were on A; `--check` wrote C, then aborted. The check is also only local: other machines aren't seen, and the lock file is per checkout (`logs/duelist`) |
| **`--stop`** (a99f641) | **Works** [V]. It killed a dummy supervisor, duelist and switch. 6 s later: no process and no new log. It made no git writes (only `--status`'s read-only `git log`) and never touched `.env` |
| **`--rollback`** | **Broken** [V]. Details below |
| **No key leakage** | **Good** [V]. `.env` is sourced only inside the start subshell (`set -a`), never echoed, and there is no `set -x`. `--status` prints command lines (no key in them) and GETs `/api/clock` without a key. The switch process gets no key |
| **`git fetch` fails** | **Aborts at step 1** [V], even when the pinned sha is already local. That's safe, but it blocks a restart on bad Wi-Fi. The patch continues with the local copy when `COMMIT` is a sha |
| **Minor** | (1) "started in …" prints even when sourcing `.env` fails; the status 10 s later shows no process. (2) `bash <(git show origin/duelist-loop:…)` runs whatever the local ref holds: pin the sha in both places. (3) In zsh, `$SHA:tools` breaks: use `"${SHA}:tools"` |

**`--rollback` is broken in three ways:**
1. **Main's `run` has no `--records`.** Only `monitor` has it, but the script always appends it. argparse then exits
   with code 2, and `supervise.sh` restarts every 5 s, forever. `--status` shows a live supervisor, so it looks fine.
   Checked offline on origin/main: "unrecognized arguments: --records …". Without the flag, it parses.
2. **It stops every duelist first,** then fetches, checks out, pulls and runs the tests. If any of those fails, no
   duelist is left running.
3. **`pull --rebase` refuses a checkout with modified tracked files.** That is likely mid-session, because the live
   duelist writes `docs/duels` in that checkout.

## Defaults against the Duel Lab's SUNDAY v2 (task 5)

| Setting | Script | Lab SUNDAY v2 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SET` | C | C, if the prompt no longer states `LATE_SWITCH_LEFT` (it doesn't) | ✓ Same values as `intel/duel-sets/C.json` |
| `POLICY` | code | code, if the S1 fix passes its replay check (it does: 0 retreats) | ✓ |
| Negotiator | Haiku 4.5 | Haiku 4.5 | ✓ |
| Strategist | Opus 5.5, effort low | Opus, effort low (for the LLM fallback) | ✓ Unused under `POLICY=code` |
| `--failover-s` | 8 | 8 (the Run row) | ✓ Under code the text call is capped at 3.5 s, so 8 doesn't bind. Under `POLICY=llm`, 8 leaves the backup about 2 s of the 10 s decision budget; the audit had suggested about 6 |
| `AUTOSWITCH` | 0 (default) | **1**, with only C → A (needs a99f641's `_switch`) | ✓ Pass `AUTOSWITCH=1`, as in the command above. It is safe on a99f641; the restart rule handles R2 |
| The way back | `--rollback` | "the tested way back is `--rollback`" | **✗ Broken on a99f641 (R1).** Use the manual rollback until the patch lands |
| Code opener | seller 0.73, buyer 0.37 (price) | **0.42 in price** ("fine"; per-role retracted) | **✗ R3** |

**What the opener costs, in the Lab's own simulator** [L]: `sim3`, code-first, 12 ticks at 10%, 4,000 duels per world
in 6 worlds, paired seeds. The baseline lands on 0.423, against the Lab's 0.421 at 10,000 duels per world.

| Set | Opener 0.42 (Lab) | Branch (0.73 / 0.37) | Δ | Seller Δ | Buyer Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C | 0.423 | 0.401 | **−0.022** | −0.057 | +0.014 |
| A | 0.397 | 0.378 | −0.020 | −0.050 | +0.011 |

- **Over Duels III (68 duels):** −0.022 a duel ≈ −1.5 points; ≈ −0.75 in the Final (34 duels), using the Lab's own
  conversion (0.080 a duel ≈ 5.4 points).
- **The patch's mix, seller 0.42 and buyer 0.37:** ≈ 0.430 under C, from the same runs.
- **Even unfixed, code-first C (0.401) still beats** the alternative, LLM C with 30% timeouts (0.387).

## Remaining risks, ranked

1. **R1: `--rollback` crash-loops and stops the duelist before its checks.** It only matters in an emergency, but then
   no duels get played. The patch fixes it.
   - **Tested:** the checks-first order, in a throwaway clone. Main's `run` parses Saturday's flags without
     `--records`.
   - **Not run end to end:** the patched start itself.
   - **Until it lands:** roll back by hand (above).
2. **R2: a re-run of start or `--check` while live rewrites the live params file and checks out code before it
   refuses.** With `AUTOSWITCH=1`, this also resets A → C for good. Fixed by the patch (the duelist check moves to
   step 1); until then, follow the rule.
3. **R3: the seller opener at 0.73,** about −0.022 a duel [L], so about −1.5 points in Duels III and −0.75 in the
   Final. Fixed by the patch.
4. **C's holds (evidence risk, unchanged from the audit).** Mid-duel, C concedes only when the gap is at least 66.7
   P in worth (0.12 × gap ≥ 8). Otherwise it waits for the last 3 ticks and the deadline accept. That is what the Lab
   simulated. In Duels II it would have held or raised 12 closing offers, and C holds more. Watch the deal rate; the
   switch rule is the insurance.
5. **An unreadable day weight under code** (low probability: every Duels II duel's weight was readable; high cost).
   Code treats the day as free.
   - **Fuzz** [L]: 5 accepts below the true limit and about 490 offers past it per 6,000 such duels.
   - **The patch mitigates, it doesn't fix:** it hands the duel to the models, but when the models fail or time out,
     `safe_move` still treats the day as free.
   - **Watch the log** for a days duel whose weight isn't read.
6. **A missing params file at start plays "today" silently.** Only on a start that bypasses the script. Fixed by the
   patch.
7. **The LLM-path residuals (only with `POLICY=llm`).** Late day flips and the give premium pass the guards. At
   `--failover-s 8`, the backup gets about 2 s of the 10 s budget.
8. **The one-duelist check is local only,** and the lock is per checkout. Confirm in the team chat that nothing else
   runs on the team key.
9. **A failed `git fetch` blocks a restart.** Fixed by the patch for a pinned sha.
10. **Small:** an accept-price mismatch isn't logged; `switched` isn't restored after a restart (moot under C); and
    `docs/duelist-loop.md` still describes the old `--rollback`.

## Appendix: the fix patch on a99f641 (6 files, +30 −24; 576 passed; replay C: 0 flags, seller opener 0.43 in price / 0.69 in worth)

What it changes:
- **`tools/duelist_sunday.sh`:**
  - the one-duelist check comes first;
  - a failed fetch is tolerated for a pinned sha;
  - `start_in` passes `--records` only when given, and refuses without `.env`;
  - `--rollback` checks everything first (no agents/engine edits, on main, the duelist identical to origin/main, the
    tests, `.env`), then stops, then starts without `--records`. It no longer pulls.
- **Code:**
  - seller opener 0.42;
  - the `Params` stamp sentinel;
  - code policy hands an unreadable-weight days duel to the models;
  - four test lines.
- **Tested:**
  - the suite: 576 passed;
  - the set C replays: 0 flags;
  - `--check`: clean, it passes. With a dummy duelist running, it aborts at step 1 and the params stay on A. With the
    fetch failing on a pinned sha, it continues;
  - `--rollback`, in a throwaway clone: with a code edit, it aborts with both dummies still alive. With no `.env`, it
    aborts before stopping anything.
- **Not tested:** the patched rollback's start itself, and the A and today replays on the patched code.

## Delta audit 29aa1be

_Independent delta audit, Sun 06:05-06:30, of `origin/duelist-loop` at 29aa1be (7a0d516 + 29aa1be on top of
a99f641). Offline only: no game server, no key read, no branch touched, no real duelist started. It ran in a worktree of
29aa1be, a sandbox `WT` and a throwaway `--shared` clone under /private/tmp, all removed afterwards. Outputs: the session
scratchpad's `delta/` folder. Labels as above._
- _**One slip:** one unstubbed `--check` was started by mistake. It died at step 2's first print (its output was piped
  to `head -1`), before any fetch, checkout or `curl`: no worktree, no `FETCH_HEAD` change and no process was left._

### Verdict: GO

**Start from 29aa1be.** R1, R2 and R3 (the three GO-WITH-CHANGES items) and R5, R6 and R9 are in, as the appendix asked.
Nothing regressed in the suite, the replays, the fuzz, the probes or the script tests. The a99f641 operating rules (never
re-run while live, roll back by hand) no longer apply: `--rollback` is now usable.

**Aleks's command** (zsh: paste as is, no `#` comments, braces kept):

```bash
git fetch origin
SHA=29aa1bed66962959ce633492d84bbc321385c7e7
git diff --stat a99f6417b644922c7ccefdf03f33f0bdcd9762a2 "${SHA}"
COMMIT=$SHA bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh") --check
COMMIT=$SHA AUTOSWITCH=1 bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh")
```

- **`git diff --stat`** must end with "8 files changed, 80 insertions(+), 32 deletions(-)": the appendix's six files plus
  `docs/duelist-loop.md` and `tests/test_duel_loop.py`.
- **`--check`** must print "579 passed" and "steps 1-4 passed". It now refuses while any duelist runs on the machine.
- **If an a99f641 duelist is already running:** stop it, check, then start on the set it was playing (`--status` shows
  `_set`; replace `C` with `A` if it shows A):
  ```bash
  bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh") --stop
  COMMIT=$SHA bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh") --check
  COMMIT=$SHA SET=C AUTOSWITCH=1 bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh")
  ```
- **While it runs:** `--status` and `--stop` only. **Don't pipe the script's output** (`| tee`, `| tail`) on a start or a
  rollback: the background `&&` list in `start_in` leaves a bash subshell, holding the script's stdout, as the
  supervisor's parent, so the pipe never closes and the command hangs until the duelist stops [V]. This is
  pre-existing (a99f641 has the same line) and harmless in a plain terminal.
- **The way back**, from your checkout on main, pulled, with no edits in `agents/` or `engine/`:
  ```bash
  bash <(git show "${SHA}:tools/duelist_sunday.sh") --rollback
  ```
  If any check fails, it stops nothing. After it, `--status` must show `agents/duelist/supervise.sh --negotiator-model
  claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort medium --negotiator-effort low` with no `--records`.
- **Never use `origin/duelist-loop` in place of the sha.** The block in `docs/duelist-loop.md` still uses it, with `#`
  comments. In zsh without `interactivecomments` (zsh 5.9's default), its start line passes `#` as `$1`, and the script
  prints its usage and exits 2 [V]. Use these lines.

### (1) Tests [V]

| Commit | `uv run python -m pytest -q tests` |
|---|---|
| 7a0d516 | **578 passed** (seller opener still 0.73) |
| 29aa1be | **579 passed** (a99f641's 576 + the R5 handoff test + the script-order test + the opener pin) |

### (2) The diff, item by item [V]

The code in 29aa1be is a99f641 plus the appendix patch, line for line, except the comment on `OPENER_SHARE_SELLER`.
To check, the patch was applied to a99f641 and the result diffed against 29aa1be: `agent.py`, `params.py` and
`duelist_sunday.sh` are byte-identical. The rest is `docs/duelist-loop.md` and three new tests.

| Item | In 29aa1be | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** `--rollback` | Checks, in order: no edits in `agents`/`engine`, on main, fetch (a failure is tolerated), `agents/duelist` + `engine` identical to origin/main, `tests/test_duelist.py` green, `.env` present. Only then `stop_all`, then `start_in "$MAIN" ""`, which adds no `--records`. It never pulls | **Fixed**, sandbox below |
| **R2** one duelist first | Step 1/6, before the fetch, the checkout in `$WT` and `use` | **Fixed**, sandbox below |
| **R3** seller opener | 0.42 (7a0d516 held 0.73; 29aa1be sets it) | **Fixed**, see (5) |
| **R5** unreadable weight | `respond` sends a days duel with `day_values is None` to the models: the same test as `runner.by_code` | **Done, partial as before**: see the fuzz note in (4) |
| **R6** params stamp | `_stamp = object()`. Probe: a fresh process with no file plays A, loudly (`params_missing` logged) | **Fixed** |
| **R9** fetch failure | Continues on the local copy when `COMMIT` is 7-40 hex characters; refuses a moving ref | **Fixed** |

No regression found. One ordering nit: at start, `use` (4/6) rewrites the params file before `start_in` (5/6) checks
`.env`. This is harmless, because step 1 has already confirmed that nothing is running.

### (3) `tools/duelist_sunday.sh` in a sandbox [V]

Setup: `git fetch` and `curl` were stubbed, and dummy processes (renamed `sleep`) stood in for the duelist. `WT` was a
sandbox worktree. The `MAIN` used for start mode had no `.env`, so nothing could start.

- **`--check`, nothing running:** steps 1-4 pass, with 579 tests passed and set C installed.
- **A dummy running, with `WT` left on a99f641 and params on A** (the state after a switch). This was tried with each of
  the three process patterns, under `--check` and under start with `AUTOSWITCH=1`:
  - every run aborts at **1/6**;
  - `WT` stays at a99f641 and the params stay on A (md5 unchanged);
  - no log is written and nothing starts.
- **`git fetch` failing:**
  - the full sha and a 7-character sha continue on the local copy;
  - `origin/duelist-loop` refuses ("not a pinned sha");
  - an unknown sha refuses ("no commit").
- **`--stop`:**
  - it kills a dummy supervisor, duelist and switch, and starts nothing; `WT` and the params are untouched;
  - with a dummy that ignores SIGTERM, it prints "ABORT: a duelist process is still running" and exits 1, so it never
    reports a false success.
- **`--rollback`, in a throwaway clone on main.** Each of these aborts before stopping anything, with both dummies still
  alive:
  1. an edit in `agents/`;
  2. a checkout not on main;
  3. a local `engine` commit, so the duelist differs from origin/main;
  4. a red `tests/test_duelist.py`;
  5. no `.env`.

  With every check passing and `git fetch` failing, it stops both dummies. It then starts main's `supervise.sh` (a stub,
  in the clone only) with exactly `--negotiator-model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort medium --negotiator-effort low`, with
  no `--records` and with `.env` sourced.
- **Main's real CLI** (offline parse, current origin/main) accepts those flags and rejects `--records`. `agents/duelist`,
  `engine` and `tests/test_duelist.py` are unchanged on main since 950ac89.

### (4) Duels II replays on 29aa1be [V]

**Wrong actions on the code path:** none. The 514 decisions ran under C, A and today, each both as recorded and at 12
ticks / 10%. In all six runs: **0 accepts below the limit, 0 offers past it, 0 wrong days, 0 backward moves**. The
rounding-ups are 0 under C, 6 under A, and 27 / 41 under today (late switch), as on a99f641.

**Against a99f641:** every output is identical line for line except the seller opener:

| Seller opener (n 34) | a99f641 | 29aa1be |
|---|---|---|
| Price share, median | 0.74 | **0.43** |
| Worth / limit, median | 1.00 | **0.69** |

- **The LLM-path flags are unchanged** (18 wrong days, 4 middle-day openers, 10 backward moves). They only matter with
  `POLICY=llm`.
- **A lower opener never undercuts the rival's standing offer.** `guarded()` turns an offer worth no more than theirs
  into an accept; the replay's "should accept" check found 0.
- **The re-audit's probes give the same output as its patched run.** They cover the missing params file, the mid-duel
  switch, C → A followed by "nothing written", the S1 give hold, a seller below its nominal limit, and the floor below 1.
- **The fuzz on readable weights** (6,000 duels each under C and A) raised no flags.

**R5 residual (new number, not a blocker).** This fuzz used unreadable weights and failing models. Per 6,000 duels,
before and after the handoff:

| Flag | Before the handoff | After |
|---|---|---|
| Offers past the true limit | 485 | 484 |
| Accepts below it | 5 | **18** |
| Backward moves | 7 | 7 |

- **What it means:** with the models down, the fallback accepts below the true limit slightly more often than code did.
  C and A give the same counts.
- **Why it isn't a blocker:** it needs both an unreadable weight (every Duels II weight was readable) and the models
  failing.
- **The fuzz's true-cost model is illustrative**, as above.
- **Watch the log** for a days duel whose weight isn't read.

### (5) The openers against the Duel Lab [V]

**The values match the ruling.**
- **The ruling:** `intel/duel-lab.md`, "Ruling on the code opener (Sun 02:00)", gives seller 0.42 in price units on our
  best day and keeps the buyer at 0.37.
- **The code:** `policy.py:48-49` reads 0.42 / 0.37, and `test_the_opener_shares_are_the_duel_labs` pins both.
- **The sets don't override it:** they carry no `OPENER_*` key, so the code values play under C, A and today (the
  replay headers read "opener S 0.42 B 0.37").
- **Worked examples:**
  - a seller with limit 40 opens at 57;
  - a days seller with limit 34 opens at 49 on day 10;
  - a buyer with limit 60 opens at 37.
- **The replay's 0.69 worth median** matches the Lab's "≈ 0.70 × limit in worth".

### Remaining risks after 29aa1be

- **Closed:** R1, R2, R3, R6 and R9.
- **Open, as ranked above:**
  - C's holds (watch the deal rate; the switch is the insurance);
  - the R5 residual (now 18 accepts below the limit per 6,000 unreadable-weight duels when the models fail);
  - the LLM-path residuals;
  - the local-only one-duelist check (confirm in the team chat);
  - the small items: an accept-price mismatch isn't logged, and `switched` isn't restored after a restart.
- **Added:**
  - don't pipe the script's output;
  - the runbook block in `docs/duelist-loop.md` still uses `origin/duelist-loop` and `#` comments.
