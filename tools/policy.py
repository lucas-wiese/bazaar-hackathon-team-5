"""Counterparty policy for every writer (Chief, Sat 16:20: the board is compressed, #1-#4 within 2 of us, #6-#8 within 3).

1. Never trade with a rival unless our gain >= TOP_RATIO x theirs (theirs unknown: skip). A rival: the live top
   TOP_N, or any team within RIVAL_WITHIN board points of us (Chief 17:45: t10, #6 and 1.33 behind, slipped through).
2. A page-closer (a card that may complete the counterparty's page) only to a team >= PAGE_CLOSER_GAP below us: a
   +50 (~ +4.7 board) jump can't lift a team 6 below past us, and our gain on those sales is +30-40 (unknown: skip).
3. RIVALS (Team 13, Team 17): no trade where their gain > ours (theirs unknown: skip).
4. Never our LAST copy of a card of a complete page (Chief 17:05): copies committed in our open offers (asks, swaps)
   count as already gone, so two parallel offers can't each take "the spare". `last_copy(...)`; before a manual
   Workshop conversion: `python3 tools/policy.py can-give LAV-03` (reads /api/me and /api/me/offers).
