"""The wave loop (Chief, Sat 22:00): after each closed wave of our duels, set it against the Duel Lab simulator and
propose a params diff for the duelist. It never applies anything itself: a human runs `approve`.

    python3 tools/duel_loop.py run [--wave latest|N|S.N] [--records docs/duels] [--params run/duel_params.json] [--dry]
    python3 tools/duel_loop.py approve [--proposal run/duel_loop_proposal.json] [--params ...] [--only A,B] [--by NAME]
    python3 tools/duel_loop.py revert [--params ...] [--by NAME]
    python3 tools/duel_loop.py watch [--every 60]
    python3 tools/duel_loop.py use SET --by NAME            # write one approved set (docs/duel_sets.json), whole
    python3 tools/duel_loop.py switch [--every 60] [--dry]  # the Duel Lab's one-way switch rule, on the duelist's machine

`run`, step by step:
1. The wave. Our duels of a session, in the order they started, cut into chunks of the session's `max_concurrent`
   (else the number that started together at the session's first tick: the first wave is always full). A wave is
   closed when every duel in it has the game's final payload; a short last chunk only once the session is over. Per
   duel: the result, the surplus (the game's result undone from the decay), what the rounds cost
   (surplus x (1 - (1 - d)^rounds)), the settled day against our best one, the rival's best in-limit offer when
   it beat what we got, and the share of the pie where our duel points (`scores.jsonl`) jumped for that deal alone.
2. The simulator (`tools/duel_sim_v2.py`, the Duel Lab's final: role-aware, price + delivery day; Chief 00:30):
   today's effective params (the constants in agents/duelist/, read from the source, plus the overrides in
   run/duel_params.json) mapped to a sim policy through its POLICY_KEYS, run with the session's ticks and decay in
   every role-aware world (RW), and the world closest to the wave named.
3. The proposal: one-parameter tweaks around today's values, paired against today's policy in that world. Only a
   tweak whose 95% CI is entirely above 0 and that passes `params.validate` and the CROSS checks is proposed;
   "no change proposed" is a valid outcome. Rule notes from the wave go next to it, never into the JSON.
Only a session at the setting the Duel Lab simulated proposes anything (TARGET: Duels III and the Final, 12 ticks at
10% decay; Chief 00:50): Duels III starts from an approved set (docs/duel_sets.json, `use`), and a wave of another
setting (Duels II: 16 / 8%) still gets its summary and the simulator's comparison, never a proposal.
4. The Duel Lab's switch rule (`tools/duel_gates.py`, SUNDAY v2) on the session so far, shown with its counts: at
   least 12 closed duels with a rival that spoke and a deal rate below 0.60 → the pre-approved fallback set (C → A,
   docs/duel_sets.json; Lab SUNDAY v2: C → A only), once, never back. `run` only reports it; `switch` applies it.

Sets (audit, Sun 01:00): `use SET` writes one approved set from docs/duel_sets.json as the WHOLE params file (every
set lists the same keys, so nothing of the previous set remains), with `_set` naming it; `switch` watches the
records on the duelist's machine and, when the rule fires, writes the fallback set the same way (once per set, never
back, never from a file that isn't an approved set; run/duel_switch.off or --dry stops it).

Writes intel/duel-loop.md (newest wave on top), run/duel_loop_proposal.json and, for `watch`, run/duel_loop_state.json.
`approve` and `revert` write the params file the duelist re-reads every tick (agents/duelist/params.py). No network,
no game calls. Stdlib only, so it runs with a bare `python3`.
