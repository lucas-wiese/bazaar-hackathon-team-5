"""Duel monitor: read-only flags on our live duels, a review after each wave, and a watch on Aleks's duelist tests.

    source .env && python3 tools/duel_monitor.py --once            # one evaluation now
    source .env && python3 -u tools/duel_monitor.py --every 15     # loop: once per server tick, ~15 s into it
    python3 tools/duel_monitor.py --replay docs/duels [--write]    # offline, on recorded duels (no key, no network)

Live flags (each with a severity and one line): an in-limit rival offer standing with <= 2 ticks left (critical, duel
181); a deal closed outside our limit (critical); our side silent >= 4 ticks after a rival offer, or never opened
(high: the duelist may be down); both sides still >= 3 ticks with >= 3 left (medium: hold deadlock, duels 103/104); no
live duel while a scored session is running (high); a priced message refused with `missing_days` (high, read from
Aleks's records in docs/duels/ when they are on this machine). Critical and high go to Lucas and Dani through
tools/notify.py (deduped per duel and flag); everything is printed.

After each wave of our duels it prepends a section to intel/duel-review.md (newest first). The result model:
result = our surplus x (1 - decay)^rounds, rounds = min(our priced offers, theirs).

When the latest commit touching agents/duelist/, engine/ or tests/test_duelist.py by someone else changes, it runs
Aleks's tests and notifies on failure.

GET only (clock, schedule, feed, leaderboard, duels), at most one request a second. It never writes to the game,
never prints a key, never commits. Its own state lives in run/duel_monitor_state.json (gitignored).
