"""Team 5's broker for a `board` venue. Deterministic, no LLM, no state outside the process.

Strategies (--strategy):
  auto_clone  exactly what the free stall does on the Market Test (bazaar-kit/starter_broker.py `bench_plan`): in each
              bench run, the best bid against the best ask while they cross, at the midpoint. Like the starter, it
              charges no venue fee on bench matches; --bench-fee lowers the midpoint until the buyer also covers the
              venue fee (same result at fee 0, which is the plan).
  v1          auto_clone + one rule about who is about to leave, built so it can only add: start from the stall's
              pairs, then bring in traders whose quote relaxed over the last ticks (fastest first: the impatient
              ones, likely to leave) through augmenting paths, i.e. by re-pairing the stall's traders, never by
              dropping one; in the last 2 ticks of a run, bring in every trader that can cross (most pairs that
              keep the stall's). Each tick it matches every trader the stall would, plus maybe some; never a pair
              whose quotes don't cross.
  v1_literal  experimental, for replays: the rule as first written, which may displace a stall trader: relaxing
              traders first, each with the tightest counterpart, then the stall (falls back to the stall if that
              matches fewer pairs). On the simulator it wins about as often as it loses.
All strategies cross the venue's real offers card by card as the starter broker does.

    BROKER_KEY=bk_... python3 -m broker.broker --strategy auto_clone             # live, one heartbeat line per tick
    BROKER_KEY=bk_... python3 -m broker.broker --strategy v1 --dry-run           # print the matches, post nothing
    BROKER_KEY=bk_... python3 -m broker.broker --strategy v1 --record            # also record bench sessions

Supervisor-friendly: after --max-errors consecutive failed API calls (or a rejected key) it exits non-zero, so the
`while true` loop in tools/daemons.sh restarts it. Run it from the repo root (`-m broker.broker`).
